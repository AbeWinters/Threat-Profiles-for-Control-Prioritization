IBM SecurityThe world continues to grapple with a lasting pandemic,  
shifts to work-from-home and back-to-office, and  
geopolitical changes spawning a constant drone of  
mistrust. All of this equates to chaos, and it is in chaos  
that cybercriminals thrive. In 2021, IBM Security® X-Force®  
saw how threat actors opportunistically used a shifting 
landscape to adopt tactics and techniques to successfully 
infiltrate organizations across the globe.
The IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index maps new trends and attack 
patterns we observed and analyzed from our data—drawing from billions of datapoints 
ranging from network and endpoint detection devices, incident response (IR) 
engagements, domain name tracking and more. This report represents the culmination 
of that research based on data collected from January to December 2021.
We offer these findings as a resource to IBM clients, researchers in the security industry, 
policy makers, the media and to the broader community of security professionals and 
business leaders. 
Given the volatile landscape and the evolution of both threat types and threat vectors, 
you need threat intelligence insights to stay ahead of attackers and fortify your critical 
assets more than ever.  Executive summary

IBM SecurityExecutive summaryReport highlights 
Top attack type: Ransomware was again the top attack type in 2021, although the 
percentage of attacks X-Force remediated that were ransomware decreased nearly 9% 
year-over-year. REvil—a ransomware type X-Force also refers to as Sodinokibi—was 
the most common ransomware strain X-Force observed for a second year, making up 
37% of all ransomware attacks, followed by Ryuk at 13%. Law enforcement activity has 
probably been the primary force driving down ransomware and IoT botnet attacks in 
2021, but this does not preclude a potential resurgence in 2022.
Supply chain vulnerabilities: Supply chain security was pushed to the forefront of 
government and policymakers’ attention, with the Biden administration’s executive 
order on cybersecurity, and guidance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 
CISA, and NIST doubling down on zero trust guidance. These guidelines put a spotlight 
on vulnerabilities and trusted relationships. Vulnerability exploitation was the top initial 
attack vector in manufacturing, an industry grappling with the effects of supply chain 
pressures and delays.
Most phished brands: X-Force closely tracked how cybercriminals are using phishing 
kits throughout 2021, and our research revealed that Microsoft, Apple and Google were 
the top three brands criminals attempted to mimic. These mega brands were used 
repeatedly in phishing kits, with attackers likely seeking to capitalize on their popularity 
and the trust many consumers place in them. 
Top threat groups: Suspected Iranian nation-state threat actor ITG17 (MuddyWater), 
cybercriminal group ITG23 ( Trickbot), and Hive0109 (LemonDuck) were some of the 
most active threat groups X-Force intelligence analysts observed in 2021. Threat groups 
worldwide were seeking to augment their prowess and infiltrate more organizations. 
Malware they used was embedded with greater defense-evasion techniques, in some 
cases hosted via cloud-based messaging and storage platforms to get through security 
controls. These platforms were abused to hide command and control communication 
in legitimate network traffic. Threat actors also continued to develop Linux versions of 
malware, to enable them to cross over to cloud environments more easily.5
IBM SecurityExecutive summaryKey stats  
21%
Ransomware share of attacks
Ransomware was the number one attack type observed by X-Force last year, 
decreasing to 21% of attacks from 23% in the previous year. REvil ransomware 
actors (aka Sodinokibi) were responsible for 37% of all ransomware attacks.
17 months
Average time before a ransomware gang rebrands or shuts down
Ransomware gangs studied by X-Force had an average lifespan of 17 months 
before rebranding or disbanding. REvil, one of the most successful gangs, shut 
down in October 2021 after 31 months (two and a half years).

Twenty-six percent of all attacks had targets in Asia in their crosshairs.  
Asia was the most attacked geography of 2021.7
IBM SecurityTop attack types
For the purposes of this report, we categorize attack 
types by the end goal an attacker is seeking to 
achieve once they have gained access to a victim’s 
network. Attack types differ from initial infection 
vectors, with the latter being the initial method of 
entry into a network. 
As examples, some attack types include ransomware, data theft, and 
BEC, based on the end goal of the threat actor’s operation. Examples of 
initial infection vectors include phishing, using stolen credentials, and 
vulnerability exploitation.  
The following sections provide details and data on the most prolific 
attack types our data revealed in 2021.
Ransomware
For more than three years, ransomware has been the top attack type 
observed by X-Force, and 2021 was no exception. Twenty-one percent 
of attacks remediated by X-Force incident response in 2021 were 
ransomware attacks. This is down slightly from the year prior, when 23% 
of attacks X-Force remediated were ransomware attacks; however, the 
volume of ransomware attacks has remained steady year-over-year.

IBM SecurityTop attack typesThe frequency of ransomware attacks X-Force observes tends to shift throughout the 
year, with May and June tending to see higher frequencies of attacks, while January 
tends to see lower. In addition, ransomware attacks appear to decrease in late summer 
or early fall. In 2021, that drop largely came in August and again in November, likely 
spurred by the permanent or temporary shutdown of several groups in the months prior: 
DarkSide and Babuk in May, Avaddon in June, and REvil in October.

IBM SecurityTop attack types
According to X-Force research, 17 months is the average 
time before a ransomware group either rebrands or shuts 
down, with a median of 18 months. Ransomware groups 
often spring up and rebrand once there is a threat of 
arrest or action by law enforcement. In some cases, law 
enforcement action forces ransomware groups to shut 
down entirely. Despite this dynamic environment—or 
perhaps because of it—many ransomware actors remain 
at large, and X-Force assesses that criminal ransomware 
activity will continue into the foreseeable future, based 
on the high profits generated by this activity and current 
limitations on law enforcement for widely shutting 
down ransomware activity. X-Force is aware of many 
ransomware actors that have rebranded and continued 
operations under new names, with GandCrab to REvil, 
Maze to Egregor, and DoppelPaymer to Grief as examples.
Law enforcement activity is probably the primary factor 
driving down the percentage of ransomware attacks 
X-Force observed in 2021, but it is very likely that the 
groups we have seen disappear will rebrand and re-
emerge in 2022 under new names and that ransomware 
activity will continue.

IBM SecurityTop attack typesOf the ransomware strains observed by X-Force in 2021, REvil made up 37%—over one-
third—of all ransomware incidents our team remediated. A strong second was Ryuk, 
making up 13% of attacks observed last year. REvil actors as of mid-October 2021 
appear to have permanently shut down operations , probably due to law enforcement 
activity. Both Ryuk and REvil constitute some of the longest-running ransomware 
operations, having emerged in April 2019 and August 2018, respectively.
How ransomware attacks happen
Given the deep experience X-Force Incident Response (X-Force IR) has in remediating 
ransomware attacks, our team has observed a recent pattern emerge across the vast 
majority of ransomware attacks. In particular, we have been able to develop a five-stage  
model that defines the common pattern observed in most ransomware incidents.

(Source: IBM Security X-Force) 13
IBM SecurityTop attack typesStage 1: Initial access
The most common access vectors for 
ransomware attacks continue to be 
phishing, vulnerability exploitation,  
and remote services such as remote 
desktop protocol. 
Stage 2: Post exploitation   
Depending on the initial access vector,  
the second stage may involve an 
intermediary remote access tool (RAT)  
or malware prior to establishing interactive 
access with an offensive security tool such 
as Cobalt Strike or Metasploit. 
Stage 3: Understand and expand
During the third stage of the attack, 
attackers have consistently focused 
on understanding the local system and 
domain that they currently have access  
to and acquiring additional credentials  
to enable lateral movement. 
Stage 4: Data collection and exfiltration
Almost every ransomware incident X-Force 
IR has responded to since 2019 has 
involved the “double extortion” tactic of 
data theft and ransomware. During stage 4 
of the attack, the focus of the ransomware 
operators switched primarily to identifying 
valuable data and exfiltrating it. 
Stage 5: Ransomware deployment
In almost every single ransomware 
incident X-Force IR has responded to, the 
ransomware operators targeted a domain 
controller as the distribution point for the 
ransomware payload.Figure 5

X-Force Incident R esponse (Source: IBM Security X -Force)14
IBM SecurityTop attack typesA concerning new trend in ransomware has been the expansion of “triple extortion” 
tactics. In this type of attack, threat actors encrypt and steal data and also threaten 
to engage in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against the affected 
organization. This kind of attack is particularly problematic for organizations 
because victims have their networks held hostage with two kinds of malicious 
attacks—often simultaneously—and are then further victimized by the theft (and 
often leak) of data.  
Ransomware gangs are beginning to look to their primary victim’s extended 
business partners to pressure them into paying a ransom to prevent their own  
data leakages or business disruptions caused by the ransomware attack.
Server access
Server access attacks—where the attacker gained unauthorized access to a server,  
but the final end goal is unknown—was the second-most common attack type,  
making up 11% of all incidents X-Force IR team remediated in 2021. 
The majority of these attacks occurred in Asia, and in many cases the threat actors 
were successful in deploying malware or employing penetration testing tools on 
a server, including China Chopper Webshells, Black Orifice malware, Printspoofer, 
and Mimikatz. 
In some instances, the threat actors exploited a known vulnerability, such as  
CVE-2020-7961, which would allow for remote code execution on a server.  
In multiple cases threat actors exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange   
servers to gain unauthorized access to networks of interest. These vulnerabilities  
are included in the top 10 vulnerabilities of 2021 listed below.
Some of the server access attacks observed by X-Force’s IR team may have  
been failed attempts to steal data or deploy ransomware. Thus, while companies 
aim to prevent attackers from gaining any level of unauthorized access to their 
networks, it’s likely that a high number of server access attacks indicates that 
organizations are identifying and eradicating attacks before they progress into 
more damaging operations.11%
of attacks were  
server access15
IBM SecurityTop attack typesBusiness email compromise
After a downturn in business email compromise (BEC) attacks in 2020, X-Force observed 
a decrease in this attack type again in 2021. BEC was the third-most common attack 
type remediated by our X-Force IR team. Last year, we theorized that widespread 
implementation of multifactor authentication (MFA) was decreasing the number of 
successful attacks BEC threat actors were able to execute. That theory held in 2021, 
since BEC attackers may have realized greater success by shifting focus to geographies 
where MFA is not as widely implemented.
For example, Latin American organizations appeared to be bearing the brunt of BEC 
attacks the X-Force IR team is remediating. North American organizations were still 
strongly in the crosshairs of BEC operations, but the surge we noticed against Latin 
American organizations suggests that BEC attackers shifted the geographic focus of their 
operations: zero percent of attacks against Latin American organizations were BEC in 
2019, but 19% of attacks were BEC in 2020 and 20% of attacks in 2021 were BEC.

IBM SecurityTop infection vectors
In addition to examining the end goal of threat actors X-Force 
observes, our team also tracks how threat actors gain initial 
access to victims’ networks. Phishing and vulnerability 
exploitation tend to be the most common methods we observe, 
followed by use of stolen credentials, brute force, remote 
desktop protocol (RDP), removable media and password 
spraying making up a small percentage of intrusions.

IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsPart of X-Force Red’s focus areas include conducting social engineering penetration testing attacks 
through phishing emails. For targeted phishing campaigns in 2020 and 2021, the average click rate for 
an X-Force Red simulated campaign was 17.8%. When vishing (voice phishing) phone calls were added 
to the campaign, the click rate rose to 53.2%, three times as effective. 
BEC attackers have leveraged phishing campaigns and social engineering with great success.  
And particularly in 2021, X-Force observed ransomware actors rely even more heavily on phishing 
campaigns to gain initial access to victim networks for ransomware attacks. Phishing
Phishing emerged as the top infection vector in 2021, surpassing vulnerability exploitation, which took 
the lead in 2020. Phishing was observed in 41% of the incidents X-Force remediated. While vulnerability 
exploitation dominated in Q3 of 2021, the significant number of phishing-related incidents X-Force 
observed in Q1 and Q4 pushed this infection vector into the lead for the year.

IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsFor example, multiple REvil ransomware incidents observed in 2021 began with a QakBot phishing 
email. These emails usually have very short messages, often refer to unpaid invoices, and occasionally 
will even hijack ongoing email conversations and reply all with only a malicious attachment. 
When opened, the document will instruct the recipient to enable macros which will drop the QakBot 
banking trojan, gaining an initial foothold on a system. The operation is then transferred to REvil 
ransomware actors who conduct reconnaissance and proceed with the operation from there.
A sample QakBot phishing email is included in figure 9.

IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsPhishing kit deployments short-lived,  
abuse technology and bank brands
IBM analyzed thousands of phishing kits from around the world to determine the 
frequency and effectiveness of this particular attack vector. Our investigation suggests 
that malicious actors who use phishing kits probably put in tedious hours with limited 
gains. In particular, our investigation showed that:
—    Phishing kit deployments generally had a short lifespan, with almost one-third of 
deployed kits being used for no longer than a day. In some cases, an individual 
deployment of a phishing kit lasted only seven-to-eight hours before most hosting 
providers identified the site as malicious and blocked it.
—    Each deployment on average had no greater than 75 potential victims who visited  
the site.
—    Phishing kits asked for user credentials (email/ID/password combinations) in nearly 
every kit observed (close to 100%), followed in popularity by credit card data (61% 
of requests), mailing address (40%), phone number (22%), date of birth (17%), 
identity card number (15%), security questions (14%), and ATM PINs (3%). When the recipient attempts to open the attachment, they are prompted by a popup  
(see figure 10) to enable macros by choosing “Enable editing” and “Enable content.” 
This allows the threat actor to deploy malware on the victim’s machine with the 
assistance of malicious macros.

companies and large financial institutions. The top 11 brands are 
listed below.
The Anti Phishing Work Group (APWG) noted that June 2021 set an 
all-time record high with 222,127 phishing attacks that month alone. 
X-Force assesses with high confidence that phishing kits will continue to 
be used by threat actors due to their easy-to-use nature and low resource 
requirement. Monitoring for suspicious connections to likely spoofed 
brands can help organizations minimize the probability of impact from 
this attack vector.
Using a DNS service that’s dedicated to data privacy, like Quad92, can 
also help mitigate the risk of phishing attacks.

IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsVulnerability exploitation
Despite dropping to the second-most common in 2021, the number of incidents  
that were caused by vulnerability exploitation this past year rose 33% from 2020, 
indicating this attack vector’s strong hold in threat actors’ arsenals. This vector  
allows threat actors to gain access to victim networks for further operations—  
in many cases with elevated privileges. 
X-Force observed actors leveraging multiple known vulnerabilities, such as  
CVE-2021-35464 (a Java deserialization vulnerability) and CVE-2019-19781   
(a Citrix path traversal flaw), to gain initial access to networks of interest. In addition,  
we observed threat actors leverage zero-day vulnerabilities in major attacks like  
the Kaseya ransomware attack and Microsoft Exchange Server incidents to access  
victim networks and devices. 
Near the end of 2021, widespread exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability  
CVE-2021-44228 also launched this vulnerability into second place in X-Force’s  
top 10 list for 2021. Several mitigation measures can assist your organization  
in avoiding becoming a victim of this vulnerability.
21 IBM Security22
IBM SecurityTop infection vectorsNumber of vulnerabilities hit another record high
Over the past five years, the number of vulnerabilities discovered per year his risen 
steadily. Even more concerning is that the number of exploits—tools threat actors can 
use to exploit a vulnerability—are also rising steadily, creating an ever-expanding array  
of options for threat actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerabilities related to Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial control systems (ICS) 
increased at an even faster rate than overall vulnerabilities, with these two categories 
experiencing a 16% and 50% year-over-year increase respectively, compared to a 0.4% 
growth rate in the number of vulnerabilities overall.

IBM SecurityThreats to operational technology and Internet of Things
Known vulnerabilities related to industrial control systems (ICS)—  
and, by extension, operational technology (OT)—as well as Internet  
of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities are increasing each year, with an 
appreciable increase in identified vulnerabilities from 2020 to 2021.
As more “things” come alive with the power of digitization and internet protocols, so do new 
vulnerabilities and risks. While many of these issues affect only industrial organizations, any 
organization that uses IoT in its infrastructure is also increasingly exposed to risk.
In addition to this increased digitization, the dynamics of supply chains are affecting the attack  
surface for many OT-connected organizations. Threat actors understand the critical role manufacturing 
and energy play in global supply chains and are seeking to disrupt these organizations because of the 
ripple effect it can have across multiple industries and the pressure these multiplying effects create  
for victims to pay a ransom.
Threat actors accelerate 
reconnaissance against  
OT devices
Analyzing data from 2021, X-Force observed attackers 
conducting massive reconnaissance campaigns 
searching for exploitable communications in industrial 
networks. Specifically, 2021 saw a considerable increase 
in reconnaissance activity targeting TCP port 502. 
This port uses Modbus, an application layer messaging 
protocol used to provide client-to-server communication 
between connected buses, networks, and programmable 
logic controller (PLC) devices in industrial networks. 
Port 502 is commonly used by supervisory control and 
data acquisition (SCADA). Access to Modbus could allow 
threat actors to control physical devices connected to 
the internet. 
Between January and September of 2021, 
X-Force observed a 2204% increase in adversarial 
reconnaissance activity targeting port 502. Figure 12

IBM SecurityThreats to operational technology and Internet of ThingsThreat actors may have heightened Modbus reconnaissance to begin finding targets to 
ransom or seize control and cause harm. Given Modbus’s lack of security features, once an 
attacker has found an accessible Modbus device, they could then issue harmful commands 
to the device and impact connected ICS or IoT systems. 
Although SCADA Modbus resides in Level 2 of the Purdue Model within ICS environments—
which ideally should be segmented from the enterprise network and placed behind a 
demilitarized zone—in some cases the SCADA Modbus port 502 can be accessed directly 
over the open internet. Lack of authentication and transmission of messages in plain text 
are some additional aspects of Modbus that make it less secure when compared to other, 
more modern technologies.
Manufacturing most targeted of OT industries, 
ransomware leads
In terms of industries with OT networks, X-Force observed manufacturing was the most 
attacked in 2021 by a significant margin, victimized in 61% of incidents X-Force assisted 
in remediating. Ransomware actors in particular find manufacturing to be an attractive 
target, likely due to these organizations’ low tolerance for down time.

IBM SecurityThreats to operational technology and Internet of ThingsFor all industries with OT networks where X-Force observed attacks in 2021—
engineering, mining, utilities, oil and gas, transportation and manufacturing—ransomware 
again led the charge for attack types, accounting for 36% of all attacks and echoing 
the overall attack trend across all industries. While the IT networks were compromised 
in the vast majority of these attacks, the impact carried over to victims’ operational 
technology in many of these instances.
Other top attack types included server access, DDoS, RATs, insiders, and credential 
harvesting operations.

IBM SecurityThreats to operational technology and Internet of ThingsMozi botnet continues to threaten IoT and OT assets
Since 2019, X-Force has identified a high volume of IoT malware activity—including a nearly 
3000% surge between Q3 2019 and Q4 2020. The Mozi botnet continued to make up the most 
significant volume of IoT malware compared to all other IoT malware types, at 74% of the total 
volume of IoT malware X-Force observed in 2021.
Mozi abuses weak Telnet passwords and exploits vulnerabilities to target networking devices, IoT, and 
video recorders, among other internet-connected products. Post-infection, it is capable of maintaining 
persistence on network gateways, which can be particularly effective initial access points for lateral 
movement to high-value networks, including OT and ICS networks. In addition, by infecting routers, 
threat actors behind Mozi can position themselves to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks that lead to 
ransomware deployment, including attacks on OT networks.
In addition to Mozi’s access and lateral movement capabilities, a large Mozi botnet that infects a large 
number of security cameras or similar IoT devices at an organization can diminish an organization’s 
ability to effectively conduct physical security operations. 
Chinese law enforcement reportedly arrested the authors of the Mozi botnet in June and August 2021, 
and the decrease in IoT attack volume in Q4 2021 is probably a side-effect of these arrests.Figure 15

IBM SecurityTop threat actors of 2021
Our 2021 IR data show that where a threat actor could be 
identified, cybercriminals were the leading source of attacks. 
Nation-state actors made up only 2% of the engagements X-Force remediated in 2021, 
underscoring the high volume of activity generated by cybercriminal activity. The nation-
state actors we observed were largely seeking to conduct espionage and surveillance, 
and in some cases, may have been laying the groundwork for future sabotage. Only 1% 
of the activity we observed was from hacktivist groups.
The following sections provide additional detail on some of the more interesting and 
active threat groups X-Force observed in 2021.

IBM SecurityTop threat actors of 2021Suspected Iran-based ITG17  
uses Aclip backdoor
In 2021, IBM Security X-Force observed a threat actor using a new backdoor that 
X-Force named “Aclip.” In addition, the adversary leveraged a legitimate messaging and 
collaboration application tool likely to obfuscate operational communications, allowing 
malicious traffic, or traffic with underlying malicious intent, to go unnoticed. Based on 
the tools, tactics, and infrastructure observed, we assess with moderate confidence that 
the threat actor we track as ITG173 (aka MuddyWater), a suspected Iranian nation-state 
group, was behind this activity for the possible purpose of surveillance. 
ITG23—Trickbot Gang—enables  
Conti ransomware operations
X-Force analysts have been closely tracking the cybercriminal group behind the Trickbot 
banking trojan—a group we identify as ITG23, also known as Wizard Spider or Trickbot 
Gang. Phishing emails with the Trickbot trojan are often used as an entry point for 
Conti ransomware, and X-Force has observed that an uptick in ITG23 Trickbot activity 
coincided with an uptick in Conti ransomware attacks. 
The group has relied on email campaigns delivering malicious Excel documents, as well 
as the notable BazarCall campaign, in which subscription themed emails encourage 
recipients to contact a fraudulent call center where the telephone operator then guides 
the user to download the BazarLoader malware, under the guise of unsubscribing from a 
service. Additionally, the group has more recently been hijacking email threads and will 
then “reply all” with malicious attachments.
Hive0109 active in 2021
X-Force observed multiple Hive0109—also known as LemonDuck—compromises in 
2021, and the group has proven itself adept at leveraging the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities 
to compromise unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers. LemonDuck targets both Linux 
and Windows systems and is known to capitalize on news-worthy events for phishing 
lures in its campaigns. 
LemonDuck is persistent malware that was primarily used to mine cryptocurrency.  
It has likely been active at least since 2018 and has since evolved into a large botnet. 
LemonDuck propagates quickly and acts as a first-stage loader for subsequent malware 
and attacks. It continues to mine for crypto coins on infected devices.
3  ITG stands for IBM Threat Group. This is IBM X-Force’s naming convention for threat actor groups—
both nation-state and cybercriminal. IBM tracks and names threat groups numerically, identified by  
IBM Threat Group (ITG) followed by an assigned number. For threat groups still in the research phase, 
we use the designation Hive, as in Hive0109 discussed in this section.31
IBM SecurityTrends in malware development
Threat actors continue to innovate and find new ways to make 
malware more capable across operating systems and more 
challenging to detect. This section describes some of the 
trends in malware development X-Force observed in 2021.
Next-level detection evasion 
X-Force’s malware reverse-engineering team uncovered over the last year significant 
upgrades in malware evasion techniques. 
—    Ransomware authors were employing different encryption techniques to avoid host-
based detection systems. One example is intermittent encryption, where separated 
blocks of data are encrypted rather than the entire system, which speeds the 
encryption process.
—    Command and control (C2) communications were increasingly using popular cloud 
messaging and storage services to blend into legitimate traffic. Additionally, the use  
of DNS for tunneling C2 communications was also becoming more prevalent.  
These techniques help attackers mask C2 activity from network-based sensors  
by posing as legitimate communications.
—     Malware authors were utilizing increasingly sophisticated packing and code 
obfuscation techniques to hide the true purpose of the malware and hinder analysis 
attempts. Malware developers also experimented with different programming 
languages such as PureBasic and Nim to decrease the ease of reverse engineering. 
Malware focus on Docker 
Analyzing malware trends impacting cloud environments, X-Force IR observed multiple 
malware families shifting their sights from targeting generic Linux systems to focusing  
on Docker containers, often used in platform-as-a-service cloud solutions.  
Some malware families illustrating this shift include XorDDoS, Groundhog and Tsunami. 
This Docker-focused push expands beyond just bots, also highlighting the malicious 
activity of IoT malware (Kaiji), cryptominers (Xanthe, Kinsing) and other malware strains 
that aim to leverage the power of cloud computing to scale their mining power.
Threat actors have also been observed targeting other container platforms in addition 
to Docker. For example, the Siloscape malware was found compromising vulnerable 
Windows containers and the Kubernetes container management platform. Siloscape is 
increasingly incorporated into attacks by actors such as TeamTNT, a cybercrime gang 
that’s been focusing on cloud platforms to expand the reach of its cryptojacking botnets.32
IBM SecurityTrends in malware developmentRansomware focus on ESXi
Analyzing malware trends impacting Linux environments, X-Force observed multiple 
ransomware families shifting their sights to target Linux-based VMWare ESXi servers. 
As more organizations increasingly rely on virtualization, ransomware authors are 
discovering that it can be more effective to encrypt the virtual machine (VM) files 
themselves, rather than infecting the operating systems running within them.
In 2020, X-Force IR observed a Linux variant of the SFile ransomware deployed against 
an ESXi server, and in 2021 a number of other ransomware families appeared to follow 
suit, including REvil, HelloKitty, Babuk, and BlackMatter. These variants will often make 
use of ESXi’s own command line management tool esxcli to enumerate and shut down 
running VMs before encrypting them.
Nim is in
In 2020, cross-platform malware developers gravitated to Golang as a programming 
language of choice, since it could be compiled for multiple operating systems at once. 
While Golang is still in use in 2021, additional languages such as Nim are becoming  
more popular. For example, threat actors used Nim to compile the Nimar backdoor   
as well as a version of Zebrocy—a malware type used by Russian nation-state actor 
ITG05 (aka APT28).
32 IBM Security33
IBM SecurityTrends in malware developmentLinux malware saw unique code increase 
in four out of five categories since the 
previous year, with the greatest increase 
being observed in banking trojans, which 
saw innovation increase over tenfold. 
This increase in Linux targeting may be 
correlated to organizations increasingly 
moving into cloud environments, which 
frequently rely on Linux for their operation. 
The level of innovation of Linux malware 
came close to that of Windows-based 
malware, highlighting just how prevalent 
Linux malware innovation has become,  
a trend that we are sure to see increasing 
in 2022 as well.Linux threats  
continue to evolve
Analysis by IBM Security X-Force Threat 
Intelligence partner Intezer found that 
over the last year, malware targeting Linux 
environments dramatically increased, 
indicating continued threat actor interest 
in this space. 
Intezer analyzes code uniqueness of 
malware strains to measure innovation. 
Malware code with more unique variations 
indicates more innovation has been used 
to edit the malware, whereas malware with 
mostly recycled code has less innovation. 
Using this methodology, the following 
results were reported.

IBM SecurityTrends in malware developmentThreat actors target cloud environments
IBM research into the cloud security threat landscape highlighted threat actors’ 
continued efforts to shift targeting into cloud environments. Data gathered showed  
that threat actors used a variety of methods to gain initial access into organizations’ 
cloud assets, with nearly a quarter of incidents stemming from threat actors pivoting  
into the cloud from on-premise networks. In addition, API misconfiguration issues  
were involved in nearly two-thirds of studied incidents. This targeting coincided  
with a robust underground marketplace for cloud-related credentials, with tens of 
thousands of accounts for sale online.  
As organizations move into the cloud, threat actors are following right alongside. 
Maintaining properly hardened systems, enacting effective password policies, and 
ensuring policy compliance is critical to maintaining a robust cloud security posture. 
Fileless malware in the cloud
Evasive, fileless malware lurking in memory can elude standard detection tools by 
exploiting legitimate scripting languages and sidestepping the use of signatures.  
X-Force research has found that, besides using scripts to launch fileless malware,  
threat actors are now using Ezuri, an opensource crypter and memory loader written  
in Golang, which makes it even easier to launch undetected malware.  
X-Force research has also highlighted the development of a new malware suite dubbed 
VermillionStrike . VermillionStrike is based on the popular penetration testing tool 
CobaltStrike; however, unlike its counterpart, VermillionStrike is designed to run on  
Linux systems. This development highlights the continued migration to malware 
targeting Linux, and likely indicates ongoing operations outside of Windows 
environments will continue into the future.35
IBM SecurityGeographic trends
For the first time since this report began 
documenting geographic trends, Asia has moved 
into first place as the most-attacked region in 2021, 
receiving 26% of attacks X-Force observed last year. 
A flurry of attacks on Japan in particular—potentially 
related to the Summer Olympic Games held in 
Japan in 2021—appear to have contributed to this 
attack trend.
 
Europe and North America followed closely behind, garnering 24% and 
23% of attacks respectively, and the Middle East and Africa and Latin 
America received 14% and 13% of attacks respectively.

IBM SecurityGeographic trendsAsia
For the purposes of reporting, IBM considers Asia to include Australia,  
East and Southeast Asia, India, and the Pacific islands. 
Server access attacks (20%) and ransomware (11%) were 
the top two attack types on Asian organizations in 2021, 
followed closely by data theft (10%). The high percentage 
of server access attacks in Asia suggests that Asian 
organizations are adept at identifying attacks quickly 
before they escalate into more concerning attack types. 
Remote access trojans and adware tied for fourth place,  
at 9% of attacks.  
In Asia, REvil made up 33% of ransomware attacks 
X-Force observed, and Bitlocker, Nefilim, MedusaLocker 
and Ragnar Locker were significant players as well. 
Vulnerability exploitation and phishing tied for the  
top infection vector at Asian organizations in 2021,  
both leading to 43% of attacks observed in the region.  
Brute force (7%) and use of stolen credentials (7%)  
were also occasionally employed to gain initial access  
to networks. 
In Asia, finance and insurance organizations were 
attacked most frequently, making up 30% of the  
incidents X-Force remediated, followed closely 
by manufacturing (29%) and then more distantly 
by professional and business services (13%) and 
transportation (10%). Globally, finance and insurance 
was the top-attacked industry X-Force observed from 
2015-2020, so Asia experienced a continuation of this 
worldwide trend X-Force has observed for years.

IBM SecurityGeographic trendsEurope
For the purposes of reporting, IBM considers European organizations  
to be located in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Turkey.
Europe emerged as the second-most attacked region  
in the world, receiving 24% of the attacks X-Force incident 
response team observed. Ransomware was the top attack 
type for Europe, making up 26% of all attacks in the  
region in 2021. Server access (12%) came in second 
place, followed by data theft (10%), misconfiguration 
(8%), malicious insiders (6%) and fraud (6%). 
Ransomware attackers are potentially drawn by the 
number of high-revenue-generating organizations in 
Europe that might be potential targets for ransomware. 
REvil attacks made up 38% of ransomware attacks on 
Europe in 2021 and Ryuk another 25%. DarkSide, LockBit 
2.0, and Crystal ransomware groups were also observed. 
These ransomware groups tend to pursue “big game 
hunting,” or targeting significant portions of enterprise 
networks belonging to large, wealthy corporations with 
the end goal of a big ransom payout.
Vulnerability exploitation was the top infection vector 
used against European organizations, accounting for  
46% of all incidents X-Force remediated in Europe,  
and followed closely by phishing at 42%. Brute force  
was used in 12% of incidents. 
Manufacturing was the top attacked industry in Europe 
in 2021, with 25% of attacks, followed by finance and 
insurance (18%) and then professional and business 
services (15%). Ransomware attackers’ focus on 
manufacturing and professional services organizations 
was probably driving these trends.
The United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany were the  
most-attacked countries in Europe.Top attacked industries

IBM SecurityGeographic trendsNorth America
For the purposes of reporting, IBM considers North America to include the  
United States and Canada.
North America emerged as the third-most attacked region in  
the world in 2021, receiving 23% of the attacks X-Force incident 
response team observed. Similar to Europe, ransomware led  
as the top attack type on North American organizations, making  
up 30% of all attacks in this region. It’s possible that the increased  
law enforcement activity in 2021, including the takedown of botnets 
and ransomware groups, are beginning to impede the attack rate  
we traditionally observed in the region.
REvil attacks made up 43% of the ransomware attacks  
X-Force observed in North America, and X-Force also observed 
LockBit 2.0, Conti, CryptoLocker and Eking. After ransomware,  
BEC was the second-most common attack type in North America, 
making up 12% of attacks and suggesting that BEC attackers  
have renewed their assault on North American organizations, 
seeking to compromise organizations that do not have MFA 
deployed. Server access attacks (9%) came in third place  
for North American organizations.
Phishing appears to be the attack vector of choice for threat actors 
targeting North America, observed in 47% of the incidents X-Force 
remediated in this region in 2021. Vulnerability exploitation came 
in second at 29%, and removable media (12%), brute force (9%) 
and stolen credentials (9%) were also used. Threat actors may 
be focused on phishing as more North American organizations 
implement robust patch management programs in the face of 
several critical vulnerabilities released in 2020 and 2021.
Manufacturing was the top-attacked industry in North America, 
constituting 28% of all attacks X-Force remediated—an attack rate 
probably associated with the significant supply chain-related strain 
on manufacturing emerging from the pandemic. Professional and 
business services came in second place at 15%, followed by retail 
and wholesale at 11%. Manufacturing, professional services and 
wholesale are all attractive targets for ransomware actors possibly 
due to their low tolerance for downtime and sensitive client data on 
their networks that—if stolen and threatened to be leaked—can put 
intense pressure on a victim to pay a ransom.Top attacked industries

IBM SecurityGeographic trendsMiddle East and Africa
For the purposes of reporting, IBM considers the Middle East and Africa to 
include the Levant, Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Iran and Iraq, and the entire 
African continent.
Ransomware and server access attacks were the top 
incident types for the Middle East and Africa, tying for  
first place with 18% of attacks each. Misconfiguration  
was a close second at 14%, and credential harvesting  
and DDoS attacks were also fairly common in the region. 
Vulnerability exploitation led to 50% of the incidents 
X-Force remediated in the Middle East and Africa where 
the initial infection vector was known. Use of stolen 
credentials and phishing were also frequently used to 
gain access to Middle East and Africa networks of interest, 
and password spraying and use of removable media were 
occasionally used to gain initial access as well.
Finance and insurance organizations made up the 
overwhelming majority of targets in the Middle East  
and Africa in 2021, accounting for 48% of all  
attacks, signaling a potential shift from nation-state 
sponsored energy-focused attacks in the region to 
cybercriminal attacks focused on financial organizations.  
Saudi Arabia’s shift to diversify its economy away from 
crude revenues may also be impacting this trend. 
Healthcare organizations made up another 15% of  
attacks in the region, and energy organizations were 
associated with 10% of attacks in the region.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa 
were the most-attacked countries in the Middle East and 
Africa region.Top attacked industries

IBM SecurityGeographic trendsLatin America
For the purposes of reporting, IBM considers Latin America to include Mexico,  
Central America and South America.  
The top attack type for Latin America in 2021 was ransomware, 
making up 29% of attacks, followed by BEC (21%) and credential 
harvesting (21%), tying for second place. REvil was the most 
common ransomware strain observed in Latin America, making up 
50% of ransomware attacks X-Force remediated, with Ryuk and 
AtomSilo also being observed targeting organizations in the region. 
As discussed previously in this document, the rate of BEC attacks 
against Latin America is higher than for any other geography, and 
represents a sharp increase since 2019, suggesting that BEC 
attackers are focusing greater attention on Latin American targets.
Phishing was the most common infection vector threat actors  
used against Latin American targets, making up 47% of attacks 
X-Force remediated in this region. The high number of BEC attacks 
and ransomware attacks delivered via phishing is probably driving 
this trend. Stolen credentials led to 29% of attacks on Latin 
American organizations, and this high percentage compared  
to other regions suggests that more widespread use of MFA  
could help to drive down stolen credential and BEC incidents in  
this region. Vulnerability exploitation led to only 18% of incidents  
at Latin American organizations while removable media accounted 
for another 6%. 
Manufacturing was the most-targeted industry in Latin America  
in 2021, but at 22% led by only a small margin. Retail and 
wholesale (20%), finance and insurance (15%), and perhaps  
most surprisingly, mining (11%) followed closely behind. 
Professional and business services and energy were also  
fairly heavily attacked in Latin America. Ransomware attackers  
and BEC attackers appear to be interested in targeting these 
industries, probably driving the attack rate for these industries  
in Latin America.

IBM SecurityIndustry trends
For the first time in over five years of this report, finance and insurance was 
not the top-attacked industry in 2021, as manufacturing overtook it by a slight 
margin. The onslaught of ransomware and BEC attacks targeting manufacturing 
organizations—compounding supply chain pressure created by the COVID-19 
pandemic—possibly contributed to this shift. 
In addition to finance and manufacturing, professional and business services was heavily targeted in 2021, 
particularly by ransomware actors. This year, we are combining professional and business services as well 
as retail and wholesale to provide a broader picture of the industry attack landscape. It is worth noting that 
wholesale was much more heavily attacked than retail last year, with wholesale largely driving the ranking for 
this industry group. We wanted to ensure the attack level against wholesale was captured in this year’s rankings.

#1  |  Manufacturing
23.2%
of attacksTaking first place in X-Force’s ranking for the first time since 2016, manufacturing 
was the top attacked industry in 2021, targeted in 23.2% of the attacks X-Force 
remediated. 
Ransomware was the top attack type, accounting for 23% of attacks on 
manufacturing organizations and underscoring the heavy focus ransomware 
actors placed on manufacturing. Server access attacks came in second place at 
12%, representing probably some failed attacker operations. BEC and data theft 
tied for third place, at 10% each. BEC attackers are probably seeking to capitalize 
on the many supplier, sub-supplier, and wholesale shipping relationships 
manufacturing organizations develop, and attempt to redirect payments between 
partners to accounts under the BEC attackers’ control. Data theft probably aims at 
stealing sensitive intellectual property or holding data for ransom.
Vulnerability exploitation was the top infection vector at manufacturing 
organizations in 2021, at 47%, followed closely by phishing at 40%. The volume 
of these attacks probably drove the overall initial infection vector trends X-Force 
observed in 2021. Removable media (7%), stolen credentials (3%) and brute force 
(3%) also accounted for a small percentage of attacks. Although vulnerability 
exploitation came out on top, manufacturing organizations will probably want to 
devote an equal amount of effort to combating phishing threats, in addition to 
vulnerability management.
Nearly one-third, or 32% of attacks on manufacturing organizations occurred 
in Asia in 2021, with North America (27%) and Europe (26%) seeing similar 
percentages of attacks. Latin America (13%) and the Middle East and Africa (5%) 
also saw attacks on manufacturing in their region.

IBM SecurityIndustry trends22.4%
of attacks#2  |  Finance and insurance
Finance and insurance organizations were in the crosshairs of 22.4% of attacks 
X-Force remediated in 2021, placing it solidly in second place within X-Force’s 
industry rankings. Of these attacks, 70% were on banks, 16% were on insurance 
organizations, and 14% were on other financial organizations. 
The financial industry’s drop from first place suggests that the high security 
standards in place at most financial organizations are yielding concrete results 
and that the financial services industry is doing security right. In addition, hybrid 
cloud environments are dominant at financial services organizations, allowing for 
better visibility into and management of sensitive data.
Server access attacks narrowly emerged as the top attack type on finance and 
insurance organizations in 2021, making up 14% of all attacks. This was followed 
closely by ransomware, misconfigurations, and fraud, which all tied for second 
place at 10%. RATs, adware and credential harvesting were also fairly common 
attack types against financial services.
Phishing was the most common infection vector for financial services, leading 
to 46% of attacks against this sector in 2021. Vulnerability exploitation came in 
second place, leading to 31% of attacks on this sector. Password spraying, brute 
force and VPN access were also observed infection vectors against finance and 
insurance firms.
Asia saw a high volume of attacks on finance and insurance organizations in 
2021—34% of all attacks on this industry. Finance and insurance attacks in the 
Middle East and Africa were also disproportionately large, at 29%, while Europe 
(19%), North America (9%), and Latin America (9%) saw moderately small shares 
of the attacks on finance and insurance in 2021.
44 IBM Security45
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#3  |  Professional and business services
12.7%
of attacksProfessional services include information technology providers, law firms, 
architects, accountants, and specialist consultants. Business services include 
firms such as office administration, human resources, security services, travel 
arrangements, and landscaping. Together they form a larger services industry we 
are including for the 2022 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index. 
Professional and businesses services firms were third-most attacked in our 2022 
ranking, accounting for 12.7% of all attacks we observed. Of these, 24% were 
business services firms, 76% were professional services firms, and 29% were 
specifically information technology-focused professional services providers.
Ransomware was the top attack type against professional and business services  
firms in 2021, making up 32% of all attacks X-Force observed on these industries.  
Server access attacks were the second-most common attack type (19%), and  
an increase in server access attacks in Q4 2021 coinciding with a decrease in 
ransomware attacks in Q4 suggests that professional services firms did a better  
job at identifying and stopping ransomware attackers before they met their  
objectives. Malicious insiders came in third place at 13% of all attacks on the 
professional and business services industries. 
Vulnerability exploitation accounted for 50% of incidents X-Force remediated 
at professional and business services firms in 2021, with phishing making 
up another 20%. Use of stolen credentials accounted for another 20% of the 
incidents we remediated in this sector. Multiple vulnerability exploitation 
incidents involved threat actors taking advantage of the Microsoft Exchange 
vulnerabilities revealed early in 2021.
45 IBM Security46
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#4  |  Energy
8.2%
of attacksEnergy organizations were fourth-most attacked in this year’s rankings, 
experiencing 8.2% of attacks observed and dropping from third place the year 
prior. It is possible that following the blowback from the DarkSide ransomware 
attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021, threat actors—and specifically 
ransomware actors—shifted their focus away from energy organizations for 
fear of retaliation. In 2021, X-Force observed fewer incidents against energy 
organizations in all of June, July and August than in May, when Colonial Pipeline 
occurred. Attacks appeared to pick back up again in September, however.
Ransomware (25%) was the most common attack type against energy 
organizations in 2021, followed by RATs, DDoS and BEC, all of which tied for 
second place (17%). Botnets, spam and data theft also played a role against 
energy firms in 2021.
Phishing was the most common infection vector threat actors used to gain access 
to energy organizations’ networks, making up around 60% of attacks, while 
vulnerability exploitation made up the other 40% of incidents.
North America saw more attacks on energy organizations than any other region, 
claiming 31% of all energy attacks X-Force observed last year, with Europe coming 
in at 28%, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa tying for second at 17% 
and Asia last with 7% of attacks on energy.
46 IBM Security47
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#5  |  Retail and wholesale
7.3%
of attacksRetail establishments focus on the sale of finished goods directly to consumers 
while wholesale organizations focus on distributing and transporting goods directly 
from manufacturers, usually to a third party or directly to consumers. These 
industries were the fifth-most targeted in X-Force’s 2022 ranking, accounting 
for 7.3% of all attacks in 2021. Of these, 35% were on retail and 65% were on 
wholesale, underscoring the strong emphasis threat actors placed on wholesale 
organizations last year, possibly due to the critical role they play in supply chains 
and movement of goods from manufacturers to end users.
BEC, server access, data theft, and credential harvesting were the top attack types 
on retail and wholesale last year. Ransomware and banking trojans also accounted 
for a high percentage of attacks, followed by RATs, misconfiguration, and fraud.
Phishing was the top infection vector for retail and wholesale in 2021, accounting 
for 38% of the attacks X-Force remediated in this industry where the initial 
infection vector was known. Stolen credentials came in second at 31%, and 
vulnerability exploitation made up another 23% of attacks on these industries. 
Brute force (8%) also played a role in some attacks.
North America and Latin America tied for the highest number of incidents in the 
retail and wholesale industries in 2021, both claiming 35% each, and Europe was 
close behind at 31%.
47 IBM Security48
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#6  |  Healthcare
5.1%
of attacksHealthcare emerged as sixth-most attacked in this year’s rankings, receiving 
5.1% of all attacks X-Force observed in 2021 and up from seventh place the 
year prior. Of attacks on healthcare where the attack type is known, 38% 
were ransomware—a higher percentage than most other industries. AtomSilo, 
AvosLocker and REvil ransomware actors all targeted healthcare organizations this 
year. In addition to ransomware, BEC attacks (25%) hit the healthcare industry 
fairly hard this year, and server access, credential harvesting and misconfigurations 
also had an effect.
Vulnerability exploitation was the top infection vector at healthcare organizations 
in 2021, leading to 57% of the incidents X-Force remediated, followed by phishing 
at 29% and use of stolen credentials at 14%.
Healthcare organizations in the Middle East and Africa emerged as the most 
attacked in 2021, accounting for a massive 39% of attacks on healthcare, followed 
closely by North America at 33%. Asia and Latin America tied at 11% with Europe 
taking only 6% of healthcare attacks.
48 IBM Security49
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#7  |  Transportation
4.0%
of attacksThe transportation industry received 4.0% of attacks, bringing it to the seventh 
ranking, up from ninth place in 2020. As international borders and transportation 
networks reopened in 2021, renewed activity in this industry is probably attracting 
renewed attacker interest. 
Malicious insiders emerged as the top attack type against transportation 
organizations in 2021, making up 29% of attacks on this industry. Ransomware, 
RATs, data theft, credential harvesting and server access attacks all played a role 
against transportation in 2021 as well. 
Half of all incidents X-Force remediated at transportation organizations in 2021 
were initially caused by a phishing email, followed by use of stolen credentials at 
33% and vulnerability exploitation at 17%.
Asia by far saw the bulk of attacks within the transportation industry, accounting 
for 64% of X-Force incidents in this sector in 2021, followed by Europe (21%), the 
Middle East and Africa (7%), and North America (7%).
49 IBM Security50
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#8  |  Government
2.8%
of attacksThe government sector along with education tied for eighth most targeted 
in 2021, experiencing 2.8% of attacks. Server access attacks were the most 
common attack type against the public sector last year, suggesting that X-Force’s 
government clients in 2021 were particularly adept at identifying and eradicating 
threat actors from their network before the actors moved beyond server access. 
Data theft and fraud rounded out the top three attack types for government in 
2021. Vulnerability exploitation was the most common infection vector used 
against government targets, followed by phishing.
Government targeting was spread geographically, with half of all attacks in Asia 
followed closely by North America at 30%. The Middle East and Africa (10%) and 
Europe (10%) saw some targeting against government organizations as well.
50 IBM Security51
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#9  |  Education
2.8%
of attacksEducation organizations received 2.8% of attacks in 2021 based on X-Force’s 
research, thus tying for eighth place with the government sector. Adware was 
the most common attack type observed against Education organizations in 
2021, making up 33% of attacks, followed closely by ransomware at 22%. BEC, 
RATs, server access attacks and fraud were also commonly seen at education 
organizations last year.
Phishing was the top infection vector threat actors used against education, 
followed by brute force attacks. Asia was the most-attacked region in terms of 
incidents against education organizations in 2021, followed by North America. 
51 IBM Security52
IBM SecurityIndustry trends#10  |  Media
Media, which includes telecommunications, news outlets, publishers, and movie 
production, accounted for 2.5% of attacks in 2021, rounding out the top 10 most 
attacked industries. Ransomware was the top attack type observed against media 
outlets, making up 33% of all attacks X-Force observed in this sector, followed 
by server access, RAT, cryptomining, and malicious insider incidents. Brute force 
and stolen credentials are the primary methods X-Force observed attackers using 
to breach media organizations, suggesting that robust implementation of MFA 
might insulate this sector from several attack types. Europe and Latin America saw 
the largest share of attacks within the media industry, but attacks on media also 
occurred in the Middle East and Africa, North America, and Asia.2.5%

IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendations
The threats we have presented in this report have the 
potential to cause concern, as the report underscores the 
grave and increasing threat from ransomware, renewed 
threats from BEC and phishing, and highlights several 
zero-day exploits threat actors have exploited over the 
past year. However, our intention is for this information 
to empower organizations as they better understand the 
current threat landscape, and help build confidence in the 
actions they need to take to combat these threats. 
Some security principles X-Force has found helpful in combating today’s cyber 
threats include a zero trust approach, automation of incident response, and 
extended detection and response capabilities.
Zero trust assists in decreasing risk  
of top attacks
Zero trust is a paradigm shift, a new way of approaching security problems, that 
assumes a breach has already happened and aims to increase the difficulty for an 
attacker to move throughout a network. At its core is understanding where critical 
data resides and who has access to this data, and creating robust verification 
measures throughout a network to ensure only the right individuals are accessing 
that data in the right way. 
Research by X-Force threat researchers confirms that principles related to a 
zero trust approach—to include implementation of MFA and the principle of least 
privilege—have the potential to decrease organizations’ susceptibility to the top 
attack types identified in this report, particularly ransomware and BEC. 
Applying the principle of least privilege to domain controllers and domain 
administrator accounts in particular can increase barriers for ransomware 
actors, as many of these actors seek to deploy ransomware to a network from a 
compromised domain controller. In addition, implementing MFA increases the 
difficulty for cybercriminals seeking to take over email accounts by requiring that 
they provide further authentication beyond stolen credentials. Learn more about 
how to build a zero 
trust approach54
IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendationsSecurity automation enhances  
incident response
The X-Force incident response team addresses hundreds of incidents every year, 
in a variety of geographies, assisting in-house incident response analysts and 
addressing a range of attack types. Speed is of the essence, whether that means 
identifying and eradicating threat actors before they can deploy ransomware 
on a network, or quickly and efficiently resolving issues to create bandwidth for 
the next incident. In this fast-paced environment, security automation is key—
outsourcing to machines tasks that might take a human analyst or team hours, and 
identifying mechanisms for improving workflows. 
In mid-2021, IBM donated a threat hunting automation tool to the Open 
Cybersecurity Alliance, aimed at assisting security operations center (SOC) 
analysts to quickly conduct forensic investigations and address cyber incidents. 
In addition, the X-Force IR team uses IBM Security QRadar SOAR to enhance its 
incident response capabilities. 
Extended detection and response provides  
a significant advantage over attackers
Detection and response technologies—particularly when several different 
solutions are combined into an extended detection and response (XDR) solution—
provide organizations with a significant advantage in identifying and eradicating 
attackers from a network before they are able to reach the final stage of their 
attack, such as ransomware deployment or data theft. 
In multiple instances, when the X-Force IR team has deployed an endpoint 
detection and response (EDR) or XDR solution on a client’s network, IR has 
immediately gained additional insight that has assisted in identifying attacker 
activities and quickly addressed them. XDR technologies are probably helping to 
drive the increase in server access and other attack types X-Force observes that 
indicate an attacker was identified and stopped before the operation could achieve 
its intended conclusion. Learn more about

IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendationsRecommendations
The following recommendations include specific actions organizations can take to better 
secure their networks against the threats presented in this report.
Develop a response plan for ransomware. Every industry and every geography is at risk of 
a ransomware attack, and how your team responds in the critical moment can make all the 
difference in the amount of time and money lost in a response . 
—    Include in your response plan immediate containment actions, what stakeholders and  
law enforcement officials should be informed, how your organization will safely store  
and restore from backups, and an alternate location from where critical business functions 
can be run during remediation. 
—    Include in your plan a scenario of data theft and leak as part of the ransomware attack—
this is a very common tactic used today, seen in a very high percentage of ransomware 
attacks X-Force remediates.
—    Use ransomware drills to also think through whether your organization would pay a ransom 
and what factors would alter your calculus for that decision.
—    Ensure your ransomware response plan includes a specific contingency for a cloud-related 
incident, as it may require additional tools and skills. 
—    Avoid data corruption due to malware or ransomware attacks with flash storage solutions  
that help prevent data loss, promote operational continuity, and lower infrastructure costs. 
—    X-Force’s Definitive Guide to Ransomware gives additional detailed advice on how to 
respond to a ransomware attack. X-Force’s incident response team can also conduct 
a ransomware readiness assessment for your organization to help build and test a 
ransomware incident response plan. The X-Force Command Center similarly prepares 
organizations for a ransomware attack, taking into account both the business and  
technical response required.
Implement multifactor authentication on every remote access point into a network.  
X-Force has observed more organizations implementing MFA more successfully than ever 
before. This is literally altering the threat landscape, forcing threat actors to find new ways 
of compromising networks rather than leveraging stolen credentials, and decreasing the 
effectiveness of email takeover campaigns. 
—    MFA can decrease the risk of several different attack types, including ransomware, data 
theft, BEC, and server access. 
—    In addition, identity and access management technologies are making MFA 
implementation easier every year—both for implementation teams and for end-users.56
IBM SecurityRisk mitigation recommendationsAdopt a layered approach to combat phishing. Unfortunately, there is no one tool or 
solution that will prevent all phishing attacks today, and threat actors continue to refine 
social engineering and anti-malware detection techniques to circumvent established 
controls. Thus, we recommend implementing several layers of solutions that have  
a higher chance of catching phishing emails. 
—    First, effective user awareness and education is key and should include  
real-world examples.
—    Second, employ an email software security solution to put a machine to the  
task of identifying and filtering out malicious messages. 
—    Third, implement several defenses that can help to catch malware or  
lateral movement quickly should a phishing email slip through, including  
behavioral-based anti-malware detection, endpoint detection and response (EDR), 
intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDPS), and a security information and 
event management (SIEM) system. 
Refine and mature your vulnerability management system. Vulnerability management 
is an art—from identifying which vulnerabilities are most applicable to your organization’s 
network architecture, to identifying how to deploy them without breaking anything in  
the process. 
—    Having a team dedicated to vulnerability management and making sure this team  
is well-resourced and supported can make all the difference in ensuring your network 
is protected from potential vulnerability exploitation. 
—    We recommend prioritizing any of the vulnerabilities mentioned in this assessment 
that are applicable to your organization. 
—    IBM’s X-Force Exchange also includes a repository of vulnerabilities and associated 
criticality levels to assist you in identifying vulnerabilities of most concern, and 
X-Force Red can provide specialized vulnerability scanning and management services.
