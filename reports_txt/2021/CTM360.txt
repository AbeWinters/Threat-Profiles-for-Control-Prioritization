almost-70-of-major-organisations-to-increase-cybersecurity-spending-following-coronavirus-outbreak/The most recent ‘SolarWinds’ breach, a large scale supply chain attack continues 
to be unchartered territory where the full impact is still unknown. As in the past, empirical evidence from global cybersecurity incidents reveal a substantial increase in hacked and breached data. As the attack surface of organizations continue to grow with increased adoption of the cloud and third party vendors, more complexity has been added with increased usage of mobile and  IoT devices in the workplace and at home. A big contributing factor is also increasing work from home and greater employee independence.Cybercrime Statistics

https://enterprise.verizon.com/en-gb/resourc - Verizon- AccentureTechnology advancements and disruptive ideas have forced organizations to embrace digital transformation; COVID-19 has only accelerated 
the same. Many organizations were not adequately prepared and this resulted in new challenges for the Cybersecurity industry during 2020. Looking forward at the cyber threat landscape of 2021, CTM360 sheds light on the Top 9 threats expected to stand out during the year.  In ransomware attacks, cybercriminals steal or encrypt an organization’s information and demand a ransom. If the organization refuses to pay, attackers 
threaten to publicly release or permanently delete the data, which forces the organization to choose between settling a large ransom or bearing the large scale reputational and ﬁnancial loss. 
Global research predicts that businesses will fall 
victim to ransomware attacks every 11 seconds in 2021 compared to every 14 seconds in 2019. 
One of the leading causes of this surge is that businesses have less tolerance for downtime with remote work. The lack of cybersecurity governance over 
remote work motivates threat actors further. It is increasingly common for breached organizations to pay ransom instead of the far more expensive post- attack remediation cost to avoid prolonged downtime, regulatory oversight, and minimize reputational damage in the public. The success of ransomware attacks encourages cybercriminals to continue this practice.
CYBER FORECAST REPORT 2021 | © CTM3601 Spike in ransomware Attacks
“The average downtime due to 
a Ransomware attack was 19 days in Q3 of 2020 compared to 12.1 days in Q3 2019.”“In 2019-2020, the average global cost to remediate a Ransomware attack was$761,106.”THE ESTIMATED COST OF RANSOMWARE TO BUSINESSES WILL TOP $20 
BILLION IN THE UPCOMING YEAR WITH AN AVERAGE ATTACK COSTING OVER $4 MILLION.
“The average cost of 
downtime is 24 times higher than the average ransom amount.”Ref: https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damages-6-trillion-by-2021/

It exploits the fact that most organizations rely on email to conduct 
business. In a BEC scam, cyber-criminals send an email that appears to come from a legitimate source. After active reconnaissance on the victim’s mailbox, these emails are sent to make ﬁnancial requests that are timed perfectly and appear legitimate. BEC can be carried out using numerous tactics and techniques. One of the popular approaches is executive impersonation, also known as CXO Fraud.  Business Email Compromise
“$44,000 – the average cost for a 
Business Email Compromise hack.”
                                                                  
Beyond banking, ﬁnance, insurance and healthcare sectors, it is noted that online delivery 
services were highly targeted in 2020. Amazon and DHL were two of the most impersonated brands in 2020. It is expected that similar courier and delivery scams will increase in 2021. Brand oriented attack types also serve as launchpads for spear phishing and social engineering attacks.Brand Abuse 3 2 
In this scenario, the scammer assumes the personality of a high ranking executive. This tactic gives the victim a sense of urgency and persuades them to make the requested funds transfer/data disclosure with less probability of questioning the matter. One of the increasing trends to counter BEC is the correct implementation of DMARC, especially in ﬁnancially sensitive sectors. Increased staﬀ awareness and training is a high-value investment to avoid BEC.
“83% of Spear Phishing Attacks Involve 
Brand Impersonation.”
CYBER FORECAST REPORT 2021 | © CTM360The modern organization is evolving rapidly with increased cloud adoption and a greater digital presence. Accelerated by the pandemic, a majority of 
infrastructure and services have shifted online. Organizations are more focused on their online presence and are relying on it to conduct business. Brand abuse and brand impersonation will see a huge spike in the coming year as people rely more and more on online services. There has been a spike in BEC Fraud cases, increasing by 15% from Q2 to Q3 of 2020 - Abnormal Security

 These attacks include impersonation on social media, job scams, next of kin scams, investment scams, fake news, and even to launch malware. With 
such a high variety of attack types, a new industry category dubbed Digital Risk Protection is rapidly evolving.CYBER FORECAST REPORT 2021 | © CTM360With increasing remote activity, many organizations have been implementing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) & Virtual Private Networking (VPN) to allow 
access to corporate data and servers oﬀ-site. Although RDP is already one of the most commonly attacked services online, the next year is expected to see a further spike in exploitation of RDP, VPN, and other remote services.Attacks on RDP/VPN 5 
Despite the additional security layer that VPN provides, cybercriminals view VPN as an open gateway into an organization’s entire network if access is achievable. As data breaches increase, cybercriminals have an abundance of leaked credentials paired with exploits and brute force opportunities; thus almost doubling the attacks against RDP, VPN, and remote connection servers in 2021.Supply chain attacks are cyber attacks that compromise a target organization by penetrating a third party vendor of software package instead of the organization itself. This style of attack proves especially lucrative to attackers for several reasons; a breach on one vendor creates a ripple eﬀect which can have a much higher impact on all organizations downstream. During 2020, there has been an increased reliance on third parties to counter limited business and engineering resources. In addition, threats are often overlooked as organizations tend to trust the vendors they use in day to day business. 
“63% of all cyber-attacks could be 
traced either directly or indirectly to third parties.” 4
The biggest supply chain attack of 2020 was the SolarWinds hack where attackers pushed 
malicious code as part of an update package of the Orion software. This aﬀected 18000+ customers of SolarWinds which including Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and multiple US government agencies. In 2020, experts have warned of a 430% increase in supply chain attacks targeting open-source tools used across industries. These ﬁgures are expected to increase further in 2021 as organizations are deploying more third-party services and tools to facilitate their operations.Supply Chain Attack
Usually IT vendors or small businesses are the perfect entry point for hackers since they lack security controls. Organizations should evaluate the cybersecurity posture of all their third-party vendors to eliminate the risk of supply chain attacks.

- KasperskyThis risk gives rise to 3 major challenges. 
   •   Employees do not have adequate skills and knowledge in cloud security and hence it leaves an open door for hackers.   •   The current security frameworks lack adequate mapping to implement security measures on cloud services and this exponentially
        increases the risk. 
   •    Exposure of mission critical or corporate data left exposed on the internet for attackers to access.
The most common misconﬁguration is over-privileged user accounts. When attackers gain access to an associated identity with broad privileged permis-
sions, they can abuse those permissions maliciously.Data Breaches on Cloud-based Infrastructure and Services
“82% of cloud users have experienced 
security events caused by confusion over who is responsible to secure the implementations.”6
CYBER FORECAST REPORT 2021 | © CTM360Cloud adoption has its own challenges. Organizations are expected to implement their own cybersecurity infrastructure and conﬁgure them adequately to 
secure themselves. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) vendors typically have a shared security services model. Subsequently, misconﬁgurations may lead to data breaches and exposure of sensitive corporate information; this is a high risk.
“Errors caused 22% of
Data Breaches.”"Number of records exposed reaches a staggering 36 billion in 2020."

corporate IT department. This gives hackers an entry point into the network that bypasses the perimeter security. Sensitive company data is being stored on these devices, further increasing the risk of data breaches.
Additionally, the majority of people do not manage the default settings of their home router which 
leaves an entry point for hackers to access the network and conﬁdential data. Moreover they may have many IoT devices within their home network with inadequate security controls which can also prove to be a threat.Targeted threats leveraging remote work
“In corporate contexts, decision-makers 
are aware of the issue: 83% of them said that their organization was at risk from Mobile Threats and 86% agreed that Mobile Threats are growing faster than others.”8 
New security challenges are brought on by the rapid deployment of tools, technologies, and processes that enable people to work remotely. The shift in 
working practices, associated devices, and locations makes it far easier for these types of threats to go unnoticed. The rapid increase of mobile devices widens the organization’s potential attack surface. This threat is further ampliﬁed by the associated rise in cloud adoption and the short-term ‘Use Your Own Device’ (UYOD) policies that many organizations adopted to overcome remote work challenges. With the current rise in remote work, development teams are often scattered, working remotely and sharing code via online repositories. Data exposure risks will subsequently increase with limited security governance and lack of practical controls. Data Exposure on Code Repositories 7 
Developers routinely use code repositories such as GitHub to back up, share, and manage changes to code. It is a popular environment for collaborative development by the developer community; however, code repositories are also public by default, which means that anyone can ﬁnd and access code that has been uploaded to such websites.
And all too often, developers forget to remove sensitive data from their code or make the reposito-ries private before uploading them on GitHub. Malicious hackers actively scan and scrape GitHub for leaked passwords, client IDs, secret keys, and API tokens, to name a few, because they know programmers are prone to such oversight. 
Ref: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-data-exposed/
https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-data-exposed/“Unit 42 researchers analyzed more than 
24,000 public GitHub data uploads via  GitHub’s Event API and found thousands of ﬁles containing potentially sensitive information, which included: 4109 Conﬁgu-ration ﬁles, 2464 API keys, 2328 Hardcod-ed username and passwords, 2144 Private key ﬁles, 1089 OAuth tokens.”

                                     “A single Spear-Phishing 
Attack results in an average loss of $1.6 million.”Since its outbreak in March 2020, COVID-19 has been the main headline of news and media outlets. Threat actors recognized this pandemic as the most 
apparent bait to make their schemes more eﬀective. The use of the COVID-19 pandemic as a theme for phishing campaigns is expected to progress into 2021. Attacks will often coincide with signiﬁcant events or news, such as a spike in new cases or a new vaccine drug's announcement. 
Smishing and Vishing attacks are also growing as cybercriminals turn to mediums that are trusted more than email. Smishing is a type of social engineering 
attack that utilizes SMS text messaging as its medium. Vishing, on the other hand, is conducted via phone calls. There is no current ﬁlter or technology where numbers are conﬁrmed as trusted sources, making mobile phone users more vulnerable to these attacks.Phishing, Vishing, and Smishing Attacks
“According to Verizon’s 2020 Mobile 
Security Index, Smishing Attacks have increased from 2 percent to 13 percent in just the past year.”9 
CYBER FORECAST REPORT 2021 | © CTM360“In Q3 of 2020, APWG detected almost 572,000 unique Phishing websites and observed more than 367,000 unique Phishing email subjects.”There are diﬀerent variations of these campaigns.
For example, impersonating oﬃcial healthcare entities like the WHO, hospitals, and insurance companies is a prevalent pattern. Another variation that 
scammers opt for is masking as relief funds and donation campaigns. 
Other than attacks directly connected to COVID-19, a rise in activity related to the after eﬀects of the pandemic is anticipated. These may include 
ﬁctitious employment opportunities, investment propositions, threats to online collaboration activities, and various online shopping scams.
