Introduction   
TOM BURT, CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT, CUSTOMER SECURITY & TRUST
Over the past year the world has borne witness to a burgeoning cybercrime economy and the rapid rise 
of cybercrime services. We have watched this global market grow in both complexity and fervency. We’ve seen the cyberattack landscape becoming increasingly sophisticated as cybercriminals continue—and even escalate—their activity in times of crisis. New levels of supply chain and ransomware attacks were a powerful reminder that we must all work together, and in new ways, to protect the cybersecurity of the planet.
We see transparency and information sharing 
as essential to the protection of the ecosystem. Knowledge brings power, and to that end, security professionals need diverse and timely insights into the threats they are defending against.
Microsoft serves billions of customers globally, 
allowing us to aggregate security data from a broad and diverse spectrum of companies, organizations, and consumers. Informed by over 24 trillion security signals per day, our unique position helps us generate a high-fidelity picture of the current state of cybersecurity, including indicators that help us predict what attackers will do next. Our goal in creating the Microsoft Digital Defense Report is to bring together integrated data and insights from more teams, across more areas of Microsoft than ever before. We will share what we’re seeing to help the global community strengthen the defense of the digital ecosystem, and we will include actionable learnings that companies, governments, and consumers can use to further secure individuals and environments.
The Microsoft Digital Defense Report draws on 
insights, data, and signals from across Microsoft, including the cloud, endpoints, and the intelligent edge.
1 Thousands of Microsoft security experts 
across 77 countries interpret and contribute to the insights gained from our advanced engineering and threat signals. Our security experts include analysts, researchers, responders, engineers, and data scientists. We also share lessons learned from customers transitioning to a hybrid workforce and frontline stories from our incident responders. Of course, there is malign activity we do not see, some of which is reported on by others in the industry. While the defender community at Microsoft works hard to identify threats and keep our customers informed, the bad actors are skilled and relentless. By continually sharing insights we and others in the industry derive from the work we do, we hope to empower everyone to defend the online ecosystem more effectively.
Microsoft has made significant and ongoing 
investments to increase and improve the knowledge we derive from our threat signals. These investments deliver the highly synthesized and integrated insights that we share here. Our goal in aggregating these learnings is to help organizations understand the ways in which cybercriminals are continually shifting their modes of attack—and determine the best ways to combat those attacks. We write and share this report in the spirit of empowering the global community to benefit from the insights, observations, and transparency generated by our unique mission and vantage point.

 Our 2021 focus areas
2021 brought powerful reminders that to protect 
the future we must understand the threats of the 
present. This requires that we continually share data 
and insights in new ways. Certain types of attacks 
have escalated as cybercriminals change tactics, 
leveraging current events to take advantage of 
vulnerable targets and advance their activity through 
new channels. Change brings opportunity—for both 
attackers and defenders—and this report will focus 
on the threats that are most novel and relevant to 
the community as we look to the months ahead.
Looking at the threat landscape, along with data 
and signals from cross-company teams, five top-
level areas emerged as most critical to bring into the 
sharpest focus in this report: the state of cybercrime; 
nation state threats; supplier ecosystems, Internet 
of Things (IoT), and operational technology (OT) 
security; the hybrid workforce; and disinformation. 
To provide the greatest benefit, we also extract our 
recommendations and actionable learnings, and 
present them throughout the report and in our 
concluding chapter.The state of cybercrime
In this chapter, we discuss new developments in 
the cybercrime economy and the growing market 
for cybercrime services. We provide updates and 
analysis of what we are seeing in ransomware and 
extortion, phishing and other malicious email, 
malware, and the use of domains by cybercriminals, 
presenting recommendations for mitigating risk 
in each area. Finally, we share what we’re seeing in 
adversarial machine learning and what we are doing 
to stay ahead of cybercriminals in this area.Nation state threats
This chapter provides an update on what we’re 
seeing in nation state adversarial activity, including 
reports on seven activity groups we have not 
previously mentioned publicly. We provide an 
analysis of the evolving threats in this watershed 
year with an increased focus on on-premises servers 
and the exposure of widespread supply chain 
vulnerabilities. We conclude with a discussion about 
private sector offensive actors and our guidance for 
comprehensive protections.Supply chain, IoT, and OT 
security
The highly publicized events of the last year have 
made clear that securing and managing risks 
associated with supplier ecosystems is critically 
important. This chapter covers some current 
challenges in doing so in the supplier ecosystem 
and presents how Microsoft thinks about end-to-
end supply chain security in nine investment areas. 
Then we turn our discussion to what we’re seeing 
in the Internet of Things (IoT) and operational 
technology (OT) threat landscape, with guidance on 
the properties of highly secured devices. We include 
specialized use cases of IoT and present some new 
research informing IoT policy considerations.    6TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Hybrid workforce security
This chapter is about our greatest asset, our people. 
As we have moved to a hybrid workforce over 
the past year, we’ve seen developments in the 
threat landscape which point to the importance 
of adopting a Zero Trust approach. We include 
threat signals and other data across the six pillars 
of Zero Trust—identities, endpoints, applications, 
network, infrastructure, and data—and provide 
guidance based on what we’re seeing. We conclude 
with discussions about insider threats in hybrid 
work environments, and an empathy imperative 
for managing the new and significant challenges 
encountered by today’s workforce.Disinformation
This chapter addresses the unprecedented 
disinformation campaigns and related cyber 
operations by state and non-state actors, 
impacting public awareness and knowledge as 
well as enterprise operations. We look at some 
parallels in cybersecurity and discuss mitigation 
through media literacy. We include a discussion on 
disinformation as an enterprise disruptor, providing 
a four-point plan for enterprise executives. The 
chapter concludes with an in-depth exploration of 
political campaign security and election integrity, 
two areas that have been targeted by disinformation 
campaigns.Actionable insights
We open this year’s concluding chapter with a 
discussion of five paradigm shifts that will center the 
evolution of work around the inclusivity of people 
and data. The chapter concludes with a distilled look 
at the key learnings from all the previous chapters 
of this report: to minimize impact of attacks we 
must truly practice good cyber hygiene, implement 
architectures that support the principles of Zero 
Trust, and ensure cyber risk management is built into 
the business.

INTRODUCTION:  The growing threat of cybercrime 
AMY HOGAN -BURNEY, GENERAL MANAGER, DIGITAL CRIMES UNIT
Cybercrime, whether nation state sponsored or permitted, is a threat to national security. Cybercriminals are 
targeting and attacking all sectors of critical infrastructure, including healthcare and public health, information 
technology (IT), financial services, and energy sectors. Ransomware attacks are increasingly successful, crippling 
governments and businesses, and the profits from these attacks are soaring. 
The cybercrime supply chain, often created by criminal syndicates, continues to mature allowing anyone to buy 
the services needed to conduct malicious activity for financial gain or other nefarious purpose. Sophisticated 
cybercriminals are also still working for governments conducting espionage and training in the new battlefield. 
It is not hopeless, and there are two positive trends 
we have seen recently. First, more governments 
and companies are coming forward when they are 
victims. This transparency helps in several ways. It 
has made clear to governments around the world 
that cybercrime is a threat to security. Victim stories 
humanize and make clear the consequences of these 
attacks, drawing attention to the problem and allowing 
increased engagement from incident responders and 
law enforcement. Second, now that governments 
around the world recognize that cybercrime is a threat 
to national security, they have made combatting it a 
priority. Governments around the world are passing 
new laws regarding reporting, creating cross-
government task forces, allocating resources, and 
seeking out private sector assistance.The cybercrime 
economy and services
Through our investigations of online organized crime 
networks, frontline investigations of customer attacks, 
security and attack research, nation state threat 
tracking, and security tool development, we continue 
to see the cybercrime supply chain consolidate and 
mature. It used to be that cybercriminals had to 
develop all the technology for their attacks. Today, 
they rely on a mature supply chain, where specialists 
create cybercrime kits and services that other actors 
buy and incorporate into their campaigns. With the 
increased demand for these services, an economy of specialized services has surfaced, and threat actors 
are increasing automation to drive down their costs 
and increase scale. For example, we are seeing an 
increasing offer of backconnect proxies (proxies that 
rotate between mobile, residential, and datacenter 
systems) in addition to Remote Desktop Protocol 
(RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), virtual private network 
(VPN), virtual private server (VPS), web shells, cPanels 
(webhosting management dashboard), and other 
anonymization systems.WITH NO

on an infected computer), denial of service (DoS), and more. As an illustration, in some marketplaces, compromised credentials are offered by different sellers for $1.00 USD to $50.00 USD, depending on a variety of variables including the perceived value of the enterprise target. The number of sites offering services has significantly increased in the past 12 months as well as volume of credentials and variety of phishing kits.TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Among the services available to even amateur threat actors are the cryptocurrency escrow services (to ensure services are rendered as offered) that we often see in commodity ransomware campaigns where affiliate models have become firmly established. Nontechnical cybercriminals sign up with a ransomware affiliate where for 30% of the revenue, the affiliate network will supply the ransomware, recovery services, and payment services. The attacker then buys “loads” from a market and pushes the ransomware to the loads they purchased. They then sit back and collect their revenue. At times there are geographic groups of actors who may offer certain services, but most of these cybercrime markets are global in nature. A buyer in Brazil can obtain phishing kits from a seller in Pakistan, domains from the United States, victim leads from Nigeria, and proxies from Romania.
These prices have remained fairly steady over the 
past several years, but like any other market they vary according to changes in supply, demand, and externalities such as politics.  
KEY TAKEAWAYS:
• Identity and password/phishing attacks  are 
cheap, and on the rise. Why would an attacker break in when they can log in?
• Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are cheap for unprotected sites—about $300 USD/month.
• Ransomware kits are one of the many types of attack kits designed to enable low-skill attackers to perform more sophisticated attacks.Average prices of cybercrime services for sale
Organizations now face an industrialized attacker economy with skill specialization and trading of illicit 
commodities. As seen in this snapshot of average prices, many commodities that can be purchased in the dark markets are very inexpensive, making attacks cheaper and easier to conduct (which also drives up attack volume).
Not all attacks work. It’s critical that we keep 
improving our defenses to increase the failure rate 
of attacks and the associated cost to attackers.                        10TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Ransomware 
and extortion 
Ransomware basics and 
taxonomy
Ransomware and extortion is a high-profit, low-cost 
business which has a debilitating impact on targeted 
organizations, national security, economic security, 
and public health and safety. What started as simple 
single-PC ransomware has grown to include a 
variety of extortion techniques enabled by human 
intelligence and is affecting the networks of all types 
of organizations across the globe.
This combination of real-time intelligence and 
broader criminal tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) has maximized the impact of these attacks 
and driven the profits from these attacks to levels 
that were hard to imagine a few years ago. To put 
it in perspective, the publicly reported profits from 
ransomware and extortion attacks gives these 
attackers a budget that would likely rival the budgets 
of nation state attack organizations  (without even 
counting the profits from attacks that never made 
the headlines).
To counter ransomware, a global collaborative 
effort between the private sector, law enforcement, 
and government is necessary to reduce the 
profitability of this crime, make it more difficult to 
enter the ransomware market, and supply victims 
with effective tools for efficient prevention and 
remediation. Microsoft is a contributor to the 
Ransomware Task Force report, a comprehensive framework designed for taking action in combatting 
ransomware.2 Microsoft has also published a 
project plan with links to technical guidance to 
help organizations better prepare for and respond 
to these attacks and is contributing to a National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
publication containing a cybersecurity framework 
profile for ransomware risk management.3
A ransomware and extortion attack involves a 
threat actor deploying malware that encrypts 
and exfiltrates data and then holds that data 
for a ransom, often demanding payment in 
cryptocurrency. Rather than just encrypting a victim’s 
files and requesting a ransom in exchange for the 
decryption key, the attackers also exfiltrate sensitive 
data before deploying the ransomware. This 
practice prevents victims from disengaging from negotiations and raises the victim’s reputational 
costs of not paying the ransom as the attackers likely 
will not only leave the victim’s data encrypted but 
also leak sensitive information.
A series of criminal activities occur long before the 
ransomware is ultimately deployed across computer 
systems in an organization. As a result, we created a 
taxonomy that focuses on the relationship between 
entities within the ransomware ecosystem because 
any entity may play a different role at any given 
time.
Ransomware attacks have evolved into human-
operated ransomware, also known as “big game 
ransomware.”

For example, as shown in the image at right, a threat 
actor may develop and deploy malware that gives 
one threat actor access to a certain category of 
victims, whereas a different threat actor may merely 
deploy malware.
 
Post-breach response
Just as the criminal enterprise that deploys 
ransomware typically involves several stakeholders 
each with a particular responsibility, the response to 
ransomware also involves several key stakeholders.
If a victim of a ransomware attack has cyber 
insurance, that carrier will employ certain service 
providers, including an incident response firm, a 
law firm, and an organization specializing in ransom 
negotiation. Even if a victim does not have a cyber 
insurance policy, these stakeholders are common to 
finding a resolution to the ransom.
Once a ransomware gang locks a victims’ network, 
exfiltrates data, and holds the network and 
data for ransom, an incident response team will 
investigate the root cause of the breach and drive 
remediation efforts depending on the victim’s level 
of preparedness prior to the attack. If the victim has 
sufficient backups of its data or data has not been 
stolen, often the incident response team will work 
to remove the threat actor from the victim’s system, 
restore business operations, and apply future 
mitigation measures.  The incident response team will often provide the victim a report which includes 
root cause, criminal actor movement inside the 
victim network, data exposure and exfiltration, and 
remediation recommendations.
Depending on the jurisdiction of the victim, the 
victim could be subject to data breach notification 
requirements. A law firm will often assess the 
exposure of the victim’s liability and assist the 
victim with meeting its regulatory obligations. 
Importantly, the law firm will interface with relevant 
law enforcement, where appropriate. Finally, if a 
victim is unable to return to business operations, 
an organization specializing in negotiating with 
ransomware criminal syndicates will work to obtain 
the decryption key on behalf of the victim.
Sample analysis of roles and relationships between entities within the ransomware ecosystem
Ransomware syndicates and affiliates are all working together toward these interconnected threats. 
Rather than one individual behind a ransomware attack, there are multiple groups of individuals, similar 
to a shared business model.                        12TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Criminal economics: A 
changing business model
The business model for ransomware has effectively 
evolved into an intelligence operation; criminal 
actors perform research on their target victim to 
identify an optimal ransom demand. Once a criminal 
actor infiltrates a network, they may exfiltrate and 
study financial documents and insurance policies. 
They may also understand the penalties associated 
with local breach laws. The actors will then extort 
money from their victims, to not only unlock their 
systems, but also to prevent disclosure of the 
victim’s exfiltrated data to the public. After they’ve 
collected and analyzed this intelligence, the criminal 
actor will identify an “appropriate” ransom amount.
The negotiation chat, at right, with a public school 
district to extort cash in exchange for a decryption 
key to unlock the Conti ransomware deployed on 
its network demonstrates the research performed 
by the criminal in advance of the negotiation. 
Here, the criminal actor explains “we examined all 
financial documents, bank statements for the last 
year, insurance. And came to the conclusion that 
you are exaggerating about poor financial condition 
[sic]. We also calculated your possible losses from 
lawsuits from both your staff and your students for 
the leakage of their personal data. These fines will 
exceed $30 million. We are not talking about the 
loss of reputation, which in our opinion costs more.”Ransomware negotiation chat

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
There are few barriers of entry into this criminal 
enterprise. A cybercriminal does not need 
specialized code development skills to profit from 
this crime. The ransomware enterprise has evolved 
into ransomware as a service driven by human 
intelligence and research. It is no longer solely the 
province of malware developers; rather, the business 
structure is modular. Malware developers are 
recruiting hackers with access to networks promising 
a “cut” of the profit. Criminals can purchase malware 
and access to specific networks and target specific 
industries. This is effectively a crime syndicate where 
each member is paid for a particular expertise.
In the example shown below, following the crypto 
flows, we can see where a criminal enterprise split its 
bitcoin “earnings” such that approximately 15% of 
the earnings flowed to the developer/manager and 
75% of the earnings flowed to the attacker.Regardless of where ransomware is deployed, 
typically the threat actors will demand payment via 
cryptocurrency through crypto wallets. Although 
the underlying blockchain technology facilitates 
transparent cryptocurrency flows, the owners of 
wallets remain pseudonymous. Nonetheless, they 
still need to find on- and off-ramps into the crypto 
ecosystem. At its core, the criminal actor needs 
to append the blockchain with a transaction and 
ultimately find a way to cash out. There are several 
stakeholders within the cryptocurrency ecosystem 
that facilitate ransom-related transactions and 
payments. These intermediaries often exist in 
jurisdictions with governments that are historically 
unwilling to cooperate with the United States 
and others. It’s these intermediaries that facilitate 
the flow of ill-gotten earnings from ransomware. 
The private sector through civil litigation, and 
the government through prosecution, regulatory 
enforcement, and international collaboration, can 
take coordinated action against intermediaries to 
disrupt the payment process.SIDEBAR: TO PAY, OR NOT TO PAY?   
In the aftermath of a ransomware attack, companies 
are often completely offline—their security systems 
tampered with, their backup systems deleted, their 
data encrypted, and their users unable to log in. 
When operations are offline and losses pile up, it 
is important to remember that paying the ransom 
demands does not guarantee the restoration of 
operations, nor does paying prevent future attacks.
 
In addition, we have in effect, the classic “Tragedy 
of the Commons”4— while it may make sense for 
individual victims to pay for their own individual 
benefit (restore critical business operations), the 
payment also contributes to the growth of this 
damaging model for everyone. Ransom payments 
can keep the cycle turning, as described below: 
• The business model of extortionists gets 
reinforced, which also attracts more bad actors 
into the monetization strategy. Substantial 
revenue is supplied to the actors who then use 
part of it for research and development (R&D) to improve their tooling and ability to buy 
breach access to potential victim organizations. 
Some ransomware teams have significant 
amounts of funds for R&D and for buying high-
end 0-days. For example, some ransomware 
teams have budget to spend up to $1 million 
USD, or more, per 0-day. While some high-end 
ransomware teams buy 0-days, others focus 
on traditional ways to gain remote access into 
victims’ networks.
• The ransomware tools become more automated 
and effective, allowing the bad actors to 
scale and accelerate their attacks—with more 
sophistication and less effort.

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Important details to be aware of when making the 
decision whether to pay ransoms:
• On average, organizations that paid the ransom 
got back only 65% of their data, with 29% 
getting back no more than half their data.5  
• Ransom decryptors are buggy and regularly fail 
to decrypt the largest, most critical data files 
(files 4 GB+ in size).
• Decrypting data files is a slow and labor-
intensive process, most customers decrypt only 
their most critical of data files and restore the 
rest from backup.
• Restoring data does not undo any tampering 
performed by the attackers.
• Restoring data does not secure systems to 
prevent future attacks.
• Organizations must understand the legality of 
making payments in their country. Governments 
across the globe are instituting ransomware 
payment reporting requirements, may have 
penalties for payments that are made to 
sanctioned parties, and are considering laws 
that could make ransom payments illegal.Paying a ransom fuels the ransomware 
syndicates
Paying a ransom gives the criminals more 
resources to expand their operations, helping 
them become more organized and specialized. 
With more funding available, the groups 
can improve their tools and code, enabling 
ransomware to spread through networks 
undetected by antivirus software.EXAMPLE: CONTI RANSOMWARE 
The Conti ransomware first appeared around July 2020 adopting the double extortion business model. In this 
double extortion model, a victim is first extorted for ransom and for the possible publishing of their stolen 
data. Conti is also a ransomware as a service (RaaS), which is a subscription-based service allowing affiliates 
of the service ready access to ransomware-building tools and builds. Affiliates of the service agree to ransom 
percentage payouts between the ransomware developer and threat actor who performed the exploitation. Conti 
usually gains access to the victim network via other threats like Trickbot, IcedID, or Zloader. Once inside the 
victim network, Conti has a configurable reconnaissance module where it can scan internal networks looking 
for network shares and other high-value targets. Once deployed, Conti begins to encrypt user-modifiable data 
and databases based on targeted file extension lists. Upon completion of the encryption, a ransom note is left in 
every file directory with instructions for the user on how to contact the ransomware actors:

The negotiation phase starts with the threat actor, as they prove they can decrypt any files provided by the 
victim. After a final ransom price is negotiated, the ransomware actor provides a Bitcoin wallet address for 
the victim to send payment. Conti ransomware actors maintain recovery and news sites on regular top-level 
domains (as on the open web) as well as on the dark web or Tor (also known as The Onion Router).
As part of the double extortion business model, the actors behind Conti maintain a news site, which serves as 
the publishing site to prove that if the ransom is not paid, the victim’s private information will be posted publicly 
and could be sold on the black market. The Conti News site currently lists hundreds of victims with various 
samples of their private data.
Conti victims are located mostly in the United States and Europe and include public schools, healthcare 
providers, manufacturing companies, US city governments, and even public utility providers.

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
The stakes have changed. There is a massive growth trajectory for ransomware and extortion. To help protect 
your organization from ransomware, we recommend that organizations:
Deploy ransomware protection
 
Prepare a recovery plan  by making it harder to access and disrupt systems, which minimizes the monetary 
incentives for ransomware attackers and makes it easier to recover from an attack without paying the ransom. 
Limit the scope of damage  by forcing the attackers to work harder to gain access to multiple business-critical 
systems. Establish least-privilege access and adopt Zero Trust principles. These steps make it harder for an 
attacker who gets in to a network to travel across the network to find valuable data to lock up. Also, encrypt 
data at rest, and practice good backup-and-restore hygiene. This way, even if data is stolen it will be encrypted 
and not very useful to the attackers. In the unfortunate event that the attacker does encrypt your data, you will 
have a good backup to restore from and use to maintain business continuity.  
 
Make it harder to get in  by following basic cybersecurity hygiene steps that make it more difficult for attackers 
to gain access to the network. The most important of these steps is the use of multifactor authentication (MFA), 
which is important to raising friction for entry but will take time to complete as part of a larger security journey. 
Other steps, such as keeping up to date on patching and correct configuration, can be taken to identify and 
close off vulnerable entry points.Use the phases as a starting plan for what to do first, next, and later to get the most impactful elements first. 
These recommendations have been prioritized using the Zero Trust principle of assume breach, which focuses 
on minimizing business risk by assuming the attackers can successfully gain access to your environment through 
one or more methods.

Phishing and 
other malicious email 
Threat to identity 
In 2020, the FBI IC3 Report9 identified phishing 
as the top crime type for victim complaints. The 
number of reports doubled compared to the 
previous year. Phishing poses a significant threat 
to both businesses and individuals, and credential 
phishing was leveraged in many of the most 
damaging attacks last year.From our investigations on online organized crime 
networks involved in business email compromise 
(BEC), we noted broad diversification of how 
credentials are obtained, verified, and later used 
that may explain the increased threat. Threat actors 
are increasing their automation and purchasing 
tools to increase the value of their criminal 
activities. Credentials belonging to unsuspecting 
victims could be obtained from phishing websites 
that impersonate a myriad of online services, 
automatically scraping and parsing logs belonging 
to infected devices that record the keys typed on 
keyboards to guessing where credentials from one 
breached online service were reused on another.
For each credential, there are services that enrich 
the information on the identity with additional 
details on the person’s identity that includes 
name, company they work for, roles, seniority in 
company, and industry associated to the company. 
With this information, the identity could be used 
in BEC attacks, to send unsolicited messages 
(spam), to gather sensitive information, or to host 
phishing websites in related online accounts. Even 
when one attack occurs, accounts may be resold 
after automated systems verify that they remain 
compromised.Identity is further threatened by impersonation 
as may be seen in BEC attacks where one party to 
a financial transaction is impersonated to divert 
payments to an unauthorized recipient. Our 
investigations identified that threat actors would 
monitor financially inclined messages to find an 
identity to impersonate and thereafter register 
homoglyph/imposter domains to resemble the email 
of the person being impersonated. In this case, the 
person whose credentials were stolen would cause 
another person to become a victim.

Emails determined as phish
Top 10 verticals affected by phishing (Defender detections, June 2021)
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021What we’re seeing  
Types of malicious emails
Whether their goal is to phish credentials, redirect 
a wire transfer to their own bank account, or 
download malware onto a machine, attackers are 
most likely to utilize email as their initial entry 
vector for a campaign. While a lot of focus is given 
to credential phishing, malicious emails are used in 
multiple types of cyber incidents. Microsoft security 
researchers observe the following three most 
common types of malicious emails:
PHISHING 
Phishing is the most common type of malicious 
email observed in our threat signals. These emails 
are designed to trick an individual into sharing 
sensitive information, such as usernames and 
passwords, with an attacker. To do this, attackers 
will craft emails using a variety of themes, such 
as productivity tools, password resets, or other 
notifications with a sense of urgency to lure a user 
to click on a link.
The phishing webpages used in these attacks may 
utilize malicious domains, such as those purchased 
and operated by the attacker, or compromised 
domains, where the attacker abuses a vulnerability 
in a legitimate website to host malicious content. 
The phishing sites frequently copy well-known, 
legitimate login pages, such as Office 365 or Google, 
to trick users into inputting their credentials. Once 
the user inputs their credentials, they will often be redirected to a legitimate final site—such as 
the real Office 365 login page—leaving the user 
unaware that actors have obtained their credentials. 
Meanwhile, the entered credentials are stored or 
sent to the attacker for later abuse or sale.
Attackers also use consent phishing to send users 
links that, if clicked, will grant the attacker access 
and permissions to applications, such as via OAuth 
2.0 authorization protocol. In these instances, users 
may unwittingly grant the attackers permissions to 
applications that enable them to access a wealth of 
sensitive information.
 
The number of phishing emails observed in 
Microsoft Exchange global mail flow increased 
during the period from June 2020 through June 
2021. We saw a pronounced surge in November 
potentially related to holiday-themed phishing, and 
a subsequent decrease over the US winter holidays, 
potentially indicating that attackers send fewer 
messages when many people are not working.
While all industries receive phishing emails, some 
verticals within those industries tend to receive more 
phishing campaigns than others. The verticals most 
affected by phishing may change month to month 
depending on several factors, including attacker 
objectives, availability of leaked email addresses, 
or current events regarding specific sectors and 
industries.                        22TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Malware emails per week
There has been an overall downward trend in the number of emails containing malware.
Top 15 Defender detections (June 2021)
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Spyware designed to steal credentials was the most common type of malware observed through email 
delivery and was detected three times as often as the next highest detection.MALWARE DELIVERY 
Malware delivery is another example of how threat 
actors utilize emails for their objectives. A variety 
of malware variants, such as Agent Tesla, IcedID, 
Trickbot, and Qakbot, use email as a primary method 
of distribution. These emails will use either links or 
attachments to deliver malware and many times use 
techniques that overlap with phishing emails. For 
example, both malware delivery email and phishing 
email may use links that direct to a CAPTCHA test to 
evade detection from security technologies.
Since malware does not rely on user interaction in 
the same way phishing does, attackers can design 
their delivery to be less noticeable to the user. For 
example, when using attachments as a delivery 
method, attackers may use a decoy document 
with macros that, when enabled by the recipient, 
download the malware in the background without 
the user’s knowledge. In these cases, the user may 
think that the document is broken or isn’t intended 
for them and may be completely unaware that 
malicious software is running on their machine.
One of the most common methods of malware 
delivery observed in the past year was through 
password-protected archive files. These emails 
contain archive files, such as ZIP attachments 
that are password protected, to prevent security 
technologies from detonating and analyzing 
them. However, the passwords for these files are 
often included in the body of the email to enable the recipient to open the files and download the 
malware. By using these archive files to house the 
malicious document—frequently an Excel or Word 
document—the attackers can use a unique archive 
file for every recipient, making it more difficult for 
defenders to fully scope a campaign.
Interestingly, between July 2020 and June 2021 
we observed an overall downward trend in the 
number of emails containing malware, indicating 
that attackers may be using other means of entry. 
In addition, a few notable malware takedowns—
namely, Trickbot and Emotet—may have contributed 
to this overall decline. A large spike in October is 
associated with the distribution of those malware 
variants, and the rapid decrease following the spike 
aligns to when the Trickbot malware was taken down 
by Microsoft.
 
The malware that attackers distribute via email 
changes regularly for a variety of reasons, including 
malware takedowns and attacker objectives. As 
shown in the chart on Defender detections for 
June 2021, the most prolific malware observed by 
Microsoft was Agent Tesla, which is a credential-
stealing spyware. The second most observed 
malware, Tisifi, which identifies social engineering 
lures, was seen only one third as much as Agent 
Tesla. EncDoc and CVE-2017-11882 as the third 
and fifth top detections indicate that attackers still 
favor malicious documents as a common method 
of delivering a variety of threats. The fourth top                         detection, HTML/Phish, includes only phishing 
emails that use an HTML attachment. These types of 
phishing frequently take the form of fake voicemail 
phishing messages.

BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE 
While not the most prolific type of malicious email 
in terms of quantity, BEC has proven to be the 
most financially impactful type of cybercrime.10 BEC 
occurs when an attacker pretends to be a legitimate 
business account—utilizing either a compromised 
email address, a lookalike domain they have 
registered, or a free email service such as Hotmail or 
Gmail—and sends emails designed to trick recipients 
into taking some financial action, handing over 
sensitive information, or providing assets, such as 
gift cards, to the attacker. 
The most common type of BEC observed by 
Microsoft in the past year was gift card scams. In 
these scams, attackers will usually create a multitude 
of free email accounts, changing the display name 
depending on the target, though attackers have 
also registered their own domains for these attacks 
or have created target-specific free email accounts. 
They will then pretend to be someone the recipient 
works with (usually their boss or an executive at 
their company) and ask them to purchase gift cards 
(often with company funds). Frequently, these emails 
suggest that the sender wants them for a family member’s birthday gift or for employees as rewards. 
The recipient is typically asked to send the digital 
gift cards to the attacker once purchased, but we 
have also seen attackers asking the user to buy 
physical gift cards and send a photo of the code on 
the back of the card, enabling the attacker to resell 
them online or trade them for cryptocurrency.
A much more sophisticated and financially damaging 
type of BEC is wire transfer fraud. In this type of 
BEC, actors will insert themselves into expected 
financial transactions and ask the recipient to adjust 
the bank account information on an outgoing wire 
transfer. The actors will masquerade as the intended 
recipient of the funds, so this does not seem out of 
the ordinary to the victim. Once the victim wires the 
money to the new account, it is withdrawn by the 
actors and may be difficult to retrieve. Companies 
can help to avoid this type of scam by ensuring that 
financial policies require verification for changing 
accounts. Finance employees should verify via a 
means other than email—such as from a known, 
trusted phone number with the recipient—before 
making account number changes that originate 
from emails. Additionally, utilizing impersonation 
protections features in email security products can 
help prevent attackers from successfully conducting 
this type of scam.Detecting web-based phishing  
In the past year, web-based phishing attacks 
have continued to become more sophisticated. 
Phishing kits used by web-based phishing attacks 
typically use images, context-based content, and 
other advanced techniques to avoid detection. 
Our machine learning (ML) models and network 
heuristics must continuously evolve to maintain 
effective protection. The language used by attackers 
has also improved significantly; past user guidance 
to look for poor spelling and grammar is now 
less effective, particularly against targeted, more 
advanced attacks. Modern kits are sufficiently 
sophisticated to masquerade as legitimate content 
in their use of spelling, grammar, and imagery.
Phishers are increasingly leveraging legitimate 
infrastructure, but this pattern still accounts for a 
minority of detected phishing attacks.  Microsoft 
SmartScreen detected more than a million unique 
domains used in web-based phishing attacks in 
the last year, of which compromised domains 
represented just over 5%. This 5% of domains 
typically host phishing attacks on legitimate websites 
without disrupting any legitimate traffic so that their 
attack remains hidden for as long as possible.Domains created specifically for attacks tend 
to be active for shorter periods, and with fewer 
malicious URLs, than attacks that abuse legitimate 
infrastructure. Over the last year, Microsoft 
SmartScreen has seen an increase in attacks that 
begin and end within as little as an hour or two.
Malicious email techniques   
Attackers have adapted over time to make their 
emails more likely to evade detections and 
protections by utilizing aspects of legitimate 
business emails. Defenders need to protect the 
company but also have a duty to maintain the flow 
of business—and attackers rely on this fact to get 
their foot in the door. In the last year, Microsoft 
security researchers have observed attackers using 
numerous techniques across multiple malicious 
email campaigns to make emails appear more 
legitimate to both end users and protection 
technologies.

Some common techniques observed over the past year:  
COMPROMISED SENDERS > COMPROMISED SERVICES  
For years, attackers have used compromised senders to perpetuate phishing email chains, as they use the 
victim’s email account to send additional phishing emails. While this is still extremely prevalent, many companies 
have begun utilizing MFA, which reduces the effectiveness of this method. Attackers therefore are adjusting 
their methods to begin compromising entire email services, such as when NOBELIUM gained access to an email 
marketing solution that enabled the attacker to send as multiple, legitimate addresses.11
Phishing email using compromised service on behalf of legitimate companies
ABUSE OF LEGITIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE  
Defenders have often told their end users to verify aspects within an email were legitimate before interacting 
with that email, such as the sender and any links within the email. This advice is still valuable, but sometimes 
the links and senders can look legitimate but contain malicious content. Attackers are shifting to abusing 
legitimate infrastructure to mask the malicious content in their emails. For sender addresses, attackers may 
register trial tenants for services such as Office 365, which make their email appear much more legitimate. 
Additionally, attackers are using ways to mask the malicious domain in an email, either by using open redirects 
from legitimate domains or by abusing legitimate hosting platforms such as Google Drive or OneDrive. In these 
cases, it may be tricky for users to know when an email is legitimate or malicious.
Legitimate infrastructure abuse
Attackers abuse legitimate contact forms 
on websites to send emails, and legitimate 
Google sites to host malware.

FAKE REPLIES 
In addition to users being instructed to verify aspects of the email, such as the sender or links before interacting 
with them, users have also been instructed not to interact with emails they are not expecting to receive. This is 
still extremely valuable advice, but attackers are aware of this as well and have shifted their strategies to find 
ways to convince recipients that they are expecting the email. One way that they do this is by crafting fake reply 
emails. In these cases, the attacker will take the contents of a previous email from a compromised mailbox, or 
will craft an entirely new email, and include it in the body of the email in a way that appears that the new email 
is a reply. Users who have jobs that require them to email dozens of people per day may not remember each 
email they have sent. Seeing a fake reply may convince them that they are expecting the email and cause them 
to interact with malicious links or attachments. Utilizing email security features that can notify a user when 
an email is being sent from a user they have not interacted with before can help mitigate this technique. This 
technique is a favorite of malware variants such as Emotet and IcedID and is also frequently used in BEC emails.

While attackers are focusing their techniques on convincing the recipient to interact with an email, they are also 
aware that all that effort will be worthless if the email is never delivered to the victim. Because of this, threat 
actors are developing new means of defense evasion in email. It used to be enough for an attacker to include 
a password-protected archive file to evade detection, but most security technologies can now input passwords 
included in the email to detonate them and identify malicious content. Attackers have shifted to including 
CAPTCHAs and legitimate login screens for services such as Microsoft or Google that prevent detection 
technologies from reaching the malicious content.                        27TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Secret phishers: The hidden 
economy of sophisticated phish kits  
It is a long-held perception among research and 
business communities that victim credentials are 
delivered to the individual (or group) operating 
phishing campaigns. Researchers within the 
security community12 have begun to identify more 
sophisticated kits in which not only are victim 
credentials sent to the phishers running a phishing 
campaign, but they are also likely going back 
to the kit’s originating author or a sophisticated 
intermediary who has modified the kit with a hidden 
collection account before redistributing the kit. The 
Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has seen several 
variations of this technique. This stratification of the cybercrime world is an 
increased threat to business infrastructure as 
phish kit authors are more technically skilled than 
the phishers and have a much broader reach by 
orders of magnitude. The anonymity of the dark 
web enables this technique. Phishing has generally 
been known to be a scheme in which a phisher 
(or group of phishers) buys a kit on a dark web 
market, obtains infrastructure components such as 
a server, a domain to host the imitation site, and an 
email account or other endpoint to receive victim 
information. Once the infrastructure is assembled, 
they essentially just “stick their poles in the water”—
the entire process is designed to be as easy as 
possible by the authors and distributers of kits. 
Although it is important not to overgeneralize, these plug-and-play phishers have largely been viewed 
as lower-level coders compared to the much more 
sophisticated phish kit author and mastermind of 
the overall operation.

What’s in Microsoft’s phishing 
defense toolbox? How we approach employee awareness 
In 2020, the industry saw a surge of phishing campaigns that has 
remained steady throughout 2021. Internally at Microsoft, we saw an 
increase in overall number of phishing emails, a downward trend in 
emails containing malware, and a rise in voice phishing (or vishing). 
Fortunately, we were prepared with an effective foundation of protective controls to reduce the number of 
successful phishing attempts, and acknowledging the evolving threat landscape, we had expanded our controls 
to cover other vectors that could be exploited (beyond email, such as Forms and Teams).
What’s in our toolbox
There is not a silver bullet fix for phishing; it must be solved through a multipronged approach. We focus on four 
primary elements: Protective controls, User awareness, Reporting and insights, and Detect and respond.Trends at Microsoft, 2020-2021

No matter how many protective controls we have in place, mitigation remains a crucial element to combating 
the phish that make it through our defenses as threat actors increase their level of sophistication. Our security operations center is equipped with Microsoft Defender for Office 365’s tools and automation to quickly detect, investigate, and effectively remediate malicious emails. For us, the automated incident response features have been key in enabling our team to move quickly because minutes matter.
Training followed by simulations, reinforcement, and targeted simulations
Despite the increas
ed sophistication of phish, susceptibility of employees has decreased, attributed to 
increased frequency of simulations and training.Beyond detection and pr otection, it is imperative that we cultivate a security-conscious culture, equip our 
employees (our last line of defense) with skills to identify a phish, and provide a simple reporting mechanism that is a consistent experience across all platforms. Employee reporting is vital, but closing the feedback loop by validating the report is just as important.

Our approach to employee phishing awareness includes annual foundational training, simulated exercises, and 
positive reinforcement. Simulations leveraging Microsoft Defender for Office 365’s Attack Simulator and Training are built on incidents insights to ensure we are exposing our employees to phish that are realistic to the level of sophistication we may see in our environment. Employees who repeatedly fall susceptible to simulations are phished on a more frequent basis to increase their opportunity to learn through experience and preventative guidance. We also run targeted campaigns focused on high-risk groups such as new employees, executives, and their support staff. The findings from our simulated exercises are also leveraged to identify opportunities within the product to aid employees in identifying phish (such as safety tips).

Summary of recommendations about malicious emails 
1. Use MFA to lessen the impact of credentials 
being phished by attackers.
2. Develop robust user education processes that 
use positive reinforcement to teach users how 
to identify potentially malicious emails. Create 
processes wherein users can report suspicious 
emails and can receive feedback on whether 
the email they submitted was indeed malicious. 
Focus extra training on groups that may be 
more heavily targeted, such as executives, 
executive assistants, and finance employees. 
Share real-world phishing examples that your 
company has received with your end users so 
that they understand the threat and know what 
to expect.
3. Surface external emails to recipients by 
appending a tag to the subject line of any 
email that originates from an email address 
outside of your organization.
4. Enable features that allow users to spot 
emails coming from senders they have not 
communicated with in the past.
5. Review mail flow rules to ensure that broad 
rules are not inadvertently allowing malicious 
emails to be delivered.6. Create and enforce finance policies that require 
employees to verify any account information 
changes, including wire transfer information, 
with the account holder.
7. Ensure that all your email is effectively signed 
(DKIM) and verified on delivery (DMARC) 
so that your customers are protected from 
attackers trying to send messages as your 
domain/brand.
8. Enable advanced protections for your users,13 
including:
 • Look-alike domains or impersonations of  
important users in the organization.   
 • Deep analysis (detonation) of 
attachments and URLs across the     
  
 • Collaboration suite to protect against  
0-day attacks.   
 • Post-delivery protection to remove mails  
that were delivered and later determined    
  malicious.
9. Eliminate opportunities for attackers to bypass 
your security, such as allowing listing for 
senders, domains, or IP addresses.Learn more:

Malware 
Trends we’re seeing  
While phishing has grown over the last year, 
malware and the cybercrime infrastructure that 
supports attacks has also continued to evolve. 
There are key malware areas where Microsoft 
365 Defender Threat Intelligence has observed 
changing trends in recent years, many of which 
require equal parts innovative defensive strategies 
and historically resilient mitigations such as multi-
factor authentication and robust application security 
practices. 
Individualized malware techniques and actions
Within the popular malware types and delivery 
methods analyzed over the past year, Microsoft 
observed many trends in individual tactics used 
during infection. Despite the wide range of 
outcomes such as ransom, data loss, credential 
theft, and espionage, most pieces of malware rely 
on similar strategies for establishing themselves in a 
network. Windows PowerShell launched by malicious 
processes with suspicious commands or encoded 
values was the most common behavior Microsoft 
observed from malware in recent months. The next 
most common were attempts by malware to rename 
payloads to mimic system processes or replace them 
entirely, and using malware to collect data such as 
credentials from browser caches. Other noteworthy behaviors and protection 
opportunities for security operation centers are the 
use of specific reconnaissance commands, processes 
being added to startup folders, scheduled task or 
registry alterations, and malicious process execution 
by abuse of Office documents. These behaviors 
stand out due to widespread use among all malware 
regardless of sophistication, though Microsoft has 
also observed more specific tactics that are more 
difficult for enterprises to mitigate. 
Fileless malware and evasive behavior
“Fileless” malware is malware that derives most of 
its components from system processes or legitimate 
tools already on a device, which can make it harder 
to remove and detect, since more than a single file 
needs to be removed. Persistence strategies can 
include registry, scheduled task, and startup folder 
persistence to remove the necessity for malware to 
remain a static item in the filesystem. Free or easily 
available remote access trojans (RATs), banking 
trojans, and offensive toolkits like Cobalt Strike are 
routinely utilizing process injection and in-memory 
execution. These are methods of abusing stolen 
administrative privileges to move malicious code 
into running benign processes rather than in static 
files, to circumvent easy removal. To combat these 
kinds of behaviors it is imperative that security 
teams within organizations review their incident 
response and malware removal processes to include 
sufficient forensics to ensure common malware 
persistence mechanisms have been fully remediated 
after cleanup by an antivirus solution.Alert counts by activity (May-June 2021)

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Legitimate service abuse in network 
communications
Another tactic used in many malware campaigns 
this past year utilized legitimate sites in almost 
every stage of malware: delivery, reconnaissance, 
command and control, exfiltration, malicious 
advertising, and cryptocurrency mining. Cloud 
services such as Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, 
Adobe Spark, Dropbox, and others are still very 
popular for use as initial delivery of malware, while 
content “pasting” sites such as Pastebin.com, 
Archive.org, and Stikked.ch are increasingly popular 
for covert use in multi-part and fileless malware. 
In the last case, the code used in the malware is 
pulled directly from the pasting site and executed 
immediately into memory, bypassing the need to 
download malware as a single file.
Larger trends in malware propagation and behavior
BOTNET RENOVATIONS 
Botnet as a term has been evolving as well. 
Historically it was used to refer to a network of 
computers completing tasks for an operator. 
However, now most malware families could 
potentially be classified as having botnet 
components or behaviors.
As historically prevalent malware botnet 
infrastructures such as Trickbot and Emotet were 
disrupted, other malware families have replaced 
them. In their place, older botnets as well as a new class of evasive malware began delivering more 
severe secondary components at faster speeds. 
In January 2021, law enforcement performed a 
takedown, which led to the demise of the Emotet 
family of malware  and a dramatic subsequent 
decrease in Emotet encounters. Botnets such as 
Phorpiex15 gradually increased in number of infected 
base hosts and delivered numerous ransomware and 
secondary malware components to further monetize 
its behavior, including the Avaddon ransomware. 
Botnets such as Lemon Duck, Purple Fox, and 
Sysrv-Hello, surged this past year, incorporating 
new programming languages, new infrastructure, and new infection methods as well. Lemon Duck, as 
with most emerging botnets, uses over 10 distinct 
methods of infection across Windows and Linux 
environments. Newer botnets are also quick to begin 
using new vulnerabilities to infect servers. Despite 
this, most methods still rely on unpatched edge 
applications, lateral movement via connected drives, 
and weak credentials on available services. Emotet encounters 
In January 2021, law enforcement performed a takedown, which led to the demise of the Emotet family 
of malware  and a dramatic subsequent decrease in Emotet encounters.14
SEO AND MALICIOUS ADVERTISING
Search engine results and advertising are also an 
increasingly effective means of delivering malware to 
end users, both via abusing legitimate search engine optimization strategies and by utilizing existing 
infections to install browser extensions to modify 
search results and to surface illicit material attacker 
content. 
This was the case in 2020 with the Adrozek16 
malware, a browser extension used where infected 
devices would use browser extensions to replace 
legitimate search results with links to malware 
impersonating Microsoft products and other 
legitimate software. The operators of Gootkit, a 
malware infection that can led to ransomware, 
used a slightly different technique to abuse search 
engines by purchasing advertising in 2020 to uplift 
the links to compromised sites hosting the malware. 
Other information-stealing malware, such as Jupyter 
or SolarMarker, used yet another method to appear 
in search results by using documents hosted 
on services such as AWS, Google, and Strikingly 
content delivery network to lead users searching 
for common terms via search results to PDF pages 
that would ultimately establish persistence on their 
device.
Information stealing, data exfiltration, and other 
areas of malware delivery can increasingly leverage 
browser modifications and search results to achieve 
their ends. This continues to solidify a class of 
malware leveraging the browser for delivery and 
exploit across both consumer and enterprise sectors.

MALWARE TOOLS  
Malware has evolved to take advantage of tools 
that are available and, in some cases, are not 
inherently malicious. One prime example has 
been the use of Cobalt Strike, a commercial 
penetration testing tool. While Cobalt Strike is a 
penetration testing, it has been used more and 
more frequently in various attacks, ranging from 
nation state to human-operated ransomware, to perform system and network discovery actions and 
move laterally through a network. Cobalt Strike is 
specifically designed to evade traditional detection 
methodologies and offers the operator a range 
of options for performing obfuscation of their 
attack commands. These obfuscation techniques 
themselves can however become a signal, and 
identifying Cobalt Strike has become more essential 
than ever as the cybercriminal economy leads to malware that plants Cobalt Strike quickly, handing 
off to ransomware operators.
WEB SHELLS DEEP DIVE 
Web shells remain popular with advanced 
persistent threat (APT) actors of all types, including 
NOBELIUM17 and HAFNIUM18 nation state activity 
groups. As DART and the Microsoft 365 Defender 
Research Team reported in both 202019 and 2021,20 
web shell usage continues to climb among nation 
state groups and criminal organizations. Web 
shell is a piece of malicious code, often written in 
typical web development programming languages 
(such as ASP , PHP , or JSP), that attackers implant 
on web servers to provide remote access and code 
execution to server functions. Web shells allow 
adversaries to execute commands and steal data 
from a web server or use the server as a launch pad 
for further attacks against the affected organization.
The escalating prevalence of web shells may be 
attributed to how simple and effective they can 
be for attackers. Once installed on a server, web 
shells serve as one of the most effective means of 
persistence in an enterprise. We frequently see cases 
where web shells are used solely as a persistence 
mechanism. Web shells guarantee that a backdoor 
exists in a compromised network, because an 
attacker leaves a malicious implant after establishing 
an initial foothold on a server. If left undetected, 
web shells provide a way for attackers to continue to gather data from and monetize the networks 
that they have access to. In addition, the volume 
of network traffic plus the usual noise of constant 
internet attacks means that targeted traffic aimed 
at a web server can blend right in, making detection 
of web shells a lot more difficult and requiring 
advanced behavior-based detections.
In February 2020, we reported a steady increase 
in the use of web shells in attacks worldwide. The 
latest Microsoft 365 Defender data shows that this 
trend not only continued, but it also accelerated; 
in every month from August 2020 to January 2021, 
we registered an average of 140,000 encounters of 
these threats on servers, which was almost double 
the 77,000 monthly average.
Throughout 2021 we saw an even bigger increase, 
with an average of 180,000 encounters per month. 
In March 2021, we saw a huge spike in web shell 
encounters, which we attributed to the HAFNIUM 
nation state activity group targeting Exchange 
servers with 0-day exploits.
In March and April of 2021, as exploit code became 
available for web-facing on-premises Exchange 
servers, we saw a large spike in web shell detection 
rates. This was due to multiple threat actors using 
a “compromise first, monetize later” approach that 
takes advantage of customer patching delays. Actors 
jump on opportunities as soon they arise.

Web shell attacks continue to rise - Microsoft Security (2/11/2021)
Ghost in the shell: Investigating web shell attacks - Microsoft Security (2/4/2021)Summary of recommendations for malware prevention 
1. Install security updates on all applications and operating systems promptly.
2. Enable real-time protection through an antimalware solution, such as Microsoft Defender.
3. Mitigate large attack vectors such as macro abuse, exposed edge services, insecure default configurations, 
legacy authentication, unsigned script types, and suspicious executions from certain file types delivered 
through email. Microsoft offers some of these larger mitigations through the use of attack surface 
reduction rules21 to prevent malware infection. Azure Active Directory users may also leverage security 
defaults22 to establish baseline authentication security for cloud environments.
4. Enable Endpoint Detection and Response functionality to analyze and respond to threats based on 
individual behaviors and techniques proactively.
5. Enable domain and IP-based protections on hosts as well as at network gateways, if possible, to ensure 
infrastructure-based coverage is complete. 
6. Turn on potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) protection. Many antimalware solutions may label 
initial access threats such as adware, torrent downloaders, RATs, and Remote Management Services 
(RMS) as PUA. Occasionally, these types of software may be disabled by default to prevent impact to an 
environment. 
7. Determine where highly privileged accounts are logging on and exposing credentials. Monitor and 
investigate logon events for logon type attributes. Highly privileged accounts should not be present on 
workstations. 
8. Practice the principle of least privilege and maintain credential hygiene. Avoid the use of domain-wide, 
admin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of RATs 
and other unwanted applications. 
9. Educate users about malware threats, such as RATs, that can propagate through email as well as through 
web downloads and search engines.

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Malicious 
domains 
Any domain used in the pursuit of cybercrime can 
be considered malicious. Malicious domains can 
be legitimate sites which have been compromised 
to enable criminals to host malicious content on 
subdomains, or they can be entirely fraudulent 
infrastructure set up for the commission of a crime. 
Cybercriminals use malicious domains for three 
primary functions: information transmission, location 
obfuscation, and building resiliency against those 
seeking to interfere with their criminal activities.
Domains are used for data exfiltration, controlling 
ransomware communication, hosting phishing 
pages, and providing control to malware. They 
are also used as email domains to create visually 
identical imposter email aliases for deception. 
Fraudulent domains can use trademarks to deceive 
customers or provide a platform for fraud, such as 
fraudulent technical support sites.
 Domain proliferation and 
threat mitigation 
The number of domains available on the internet 
has mushroomed over the past several years. This 
includes country code top-level domains (cTLDs) 
such as .uk, .ca, and .cn; generic top-level domains 
(gTLDs) such as .com, .net, and org; and over 1,200 
new gTLDs that were introduced into the Domain 
Name System (DNS) in 2013. Due to the sheer 
number of top-level domains, and the growing 
ecosystem of domain name registries, domain 
registrars, and domain registration service providers, 
mitigating cyber threats from malicious domains 
has been further complicated. Uniformity in cyber 
threat mitigation across the ecosystem is critical. 
There is movement in this direction as evidenced 
by recent language incorporated into the Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
(ICANN) agreements with registries, which includes 
terms of use that define and prohibit illegal activity, 
and a requirement for registries to develop their 
own anti-abuse policy and monitor and address 
abusive activity.
 How domains are being used for malware  
A malicious domain is often used as a destination 
to which malware victims are directed. In this way, 
the domain both initiates the establishment of a 
communications channel with the victim and reveals 
the infected victim’s location. Knowing a victim’s 
location is important as cybercriminals use a myriad 
of methods to disseminate their malware but are 
unable to anticipate where it will ultimately be 
successfully downloaded. Therefore, cybercriminals 
engineer their malware to “phone home” to a 
malicious domain. Newly infected computers 
immediately reach out to such domains, effectively 
“announcing” their location via IP addresses. There 
are two primary ways domains are used for these 
purposes in malware:
Domains aid in obfuscating and hiding the 
cybercriminals’ location and identity
Domains directly added to malware (or “hard-
coded” domains) and incorporated into the 
communications infrastructure can effectively hide 
the cybercriminal’s true location. The cybercriminal 
sets up a domain as a proxy, or “stepping-stone,” 
which redirects the communications with a victim 
to another domain or IP . This process can consist 
of multiple “hops” spanning domains associated 
with top-level domains from around the world. It is 
common for cybercriminals to use fictitious names, 
emails, and addresses and pay for the domains with 
stolen credit cards or non-traceable digital currency.  Domains can be a mechanism to build resiliency into the infrastructure
Cybercriminals are now routinely adding domain 
generating algorithms (DGAs) to their malware, 
providing a fallback mechanism for when hard-
coded malicious domains are seized by law 
enforcement, for example. To utilize DGAs, malicious 
software includes code to generate lists of domains 
built using random characters or strings that change 
based on the day, time, and year. For example, 
on Friday, June 4, 2022, the DGA might generate 
three domains, such as ahu3rrfsirraqrty.com, 
hyrssgu5oqr4cetc.com, and wkcclsoqqpcaty.com, 
and the malware would attempt to contact those 
domains in that order. The use of DGAs increases 
the cost and complexity of disrupting cybercriminal 
communications infrastructure, requiring disruptors 
to monitor hundreds of thousands of potentially 
malicious domains, whereas the cybercriminal needs 
only one of them.

Disrupting malicious domain 
infrastructure   
Disrupting domains on Microsoft-hosted services  
Cybercriminals are now increasingly abusing 
Microsoft and third-party clouds as well as the 
services information workers and consumers use for 
day-to-day collaboration (such as email). Microsoft 
takes numerous steps to reduce cloud hosting 
abuse. We proactively detect abuse of the Microsoft 
cloud at the hosting source and neutralize it before 
attacks start or scale; we act on detections in our 
services (as in Office 365 email) and route this 
knowledge to internal services that can neutralize 
the threat; we act on customer and third-party 
reports; and we notify third-party industry partners 
of abuse on their cloud, detected by using our 
security services, so they can act to neutralize it 
at their hosting source. In the three-month period 
between May and July 2021, we disabled roughly 
15,850 phishing sites hosted on Azure. We closely 
monitor abuse and evaluate new ways to detect and 
neutralize hosting of malicious sites
FPO
Disrupting third-party-hosted domains through 
legal action   
Given that cybercriminals are increasingly deploying 
private technical infrastructure, including malicious 
domains, to carry out a wide range of cybercrime, 
it is incumbent on organizations and individuals 
to establish the necessary legal and technical 
capabilities to disrupt this infrastructure through 
legal actions.
In recent years, the private sector has used a variety 
of legal theories to pursue disruption through 
civil actions in federal court. Criminal statutes 
directed at hacking and unlawful access frequently 
provide a civil cause of action to target malicious 
infrastructure. In particular, the Computer Fraud and 
Abuse Act (CFAA), the Wiretap Act, and the Stored 
Communications Act are frequently asserted legal 
theories. Very frequently trademark theories under 
the Lanham Act23 are asserted as cybercriminals 
leverage trusted brands to deceive victims. In many 
cases, infringing domains provide the critical part of 
malicious technical infrastructure and often include 
wholesale counterfeit reproduction of legitimate 
content to confuse victims and advance criminal 
schemes. Pursuing the appropriate remedy is an essential 
component of an effectively disruptive legal action. 
A well-crafted injunction that relies on the broad 
equitable authority of federal courts enables 
plaintiffs to obtain flexible court orders permitting 
them to exercise control over the cybercrime 
infrastructure. To obtain such relief, plaintiffs 
frequently invoke statutes that support seizure of 
physical devices, computers, and servers used for 
criminal purposes. Malicious domains engaged in 
criminal activity can also be subject to seizure under 
various federal statutes and equitable theories. In 
several civil cases, federal courts have granted this 
sort of injunction for violations of the CFAA, the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Lanham 
Act, and common law claims. These legal claims 
also support court orders that direct transfer or 
disablement of domains and/or IP addresses. In this 
scenario, courts grant the transfer or disablement 
of malicious infrastructure to a private plaintiff’s 
control, and away from the control of defendants, 
which effectively disrupts the technical capability of 
cybercriminals to launch attacks and inflict harm.
 The next big threat: “Forever” 
(blockchain) domains    
Blockchain domains are an emerging threat outside 
of regulation. Over the last two years, the adaptation 
of blockchain technology has skyrocketed across 
many business verticals. Real-life applications of 
blockchain technology range from supply chain 
management, identity management, real estate 
contracts, and domain infrastructure. In recent 
years, we have observed blockchain domains 
integrated into cybercriminal infrastructure and 
operations. We first observed this on a large scale 
when investigating the Necurs botnet that reigned 
terror worldwide for years with its ability to send 
malicious spam, often with ransomware payloads. 
Necurs contained a robust backup system, which 
incorporated a DGA. In one of its DGA versions, 
Necurs produced 2,048 new domains from 43 
different TLDs approximately every 30 days, 
including the blockchain domain TLD “.bit.”
Blockchain domains are an emerging 
threat outside of regulation.

Unlike traditional domains that are purchased 
through internet registrars operating through 
the ICANN-regulated DNS system, blockchain 
domains are not governed by any centralized body, 
limiting the opportunity for abuse reporting and 
enforcement disruptions. 
Traditionally, blockchain domain purchases are 
made through a crypto wallet with cryptocurrency 
from a blockchain DNS provider. Crypto wallets 
utilize asymmetric encryption, which involves both a 
private and public key for the blockchain transaction. 
After the transaction has been executed, the domain 
name, domain IP , and transaction hash are recorded 
into the blockchain. Moving forward, the only entity 
that can make changes to the IP recorded on the 
blockchain is the person with the wallet and private 
key who made the initial transaction to purchase the 
domain. Blockchain domains work differently and pose 
challenges from both a utilization and disruption 
standpoint. Blockchain domains function either 
through software/browser plug-in or proxy 
resolution services. The challenge for cybercriminals 
with respect to blockchain domains is getting the 
most updated IP address from the blockchain to the 
computer trying to resolve the blockchain domain to 
an IP address. Because blockchain domains operate 
outside the normal DNS channels, malware authors 
must include additional resolution instructions 
for infected victims. These instructions are usually 
hard-coded into the malware and point the infected 
system to a blockchain proxy resolution service IP .
Over the years, there have been several projects 
on the internet to operate free unregulated DNS 
and support the resolution of blockchain domains. 
Most recently, the OpenNic project, which operates 
under the mission statement of “DNS neutrality and 
provide uncensored DNS access,” took on the task 
of resolving “.bit” crypto domains. Several years into 
the project, because of reported widespread abuse 
of “.bit” domains, the OpenNic project decided to 
stop resolving “.bit” domains.24 Big threats using blockchain domains
The threat landscape of criminal infrastructure 
is constantly shifting to avoid detection and 
disruption. Within the past year, some of the bigger 
threat actors on the internet have started utilizing 
blockchain domains as part of their infrastructure. 
Trickbot, the notorious banking trojan which has 
evolved its business model into providing access 
to high-value targets in the ransomware space, 
started using “.bazar” domains provided by 
Emercoin blockchain DNS. The more recent threat, 
Bazarloader, which has connections to Trickbot, 
started deploying a unique version of its DGA 
that uses “.bazar” domains. This trend of threats 
leveraging blockchain domains as infrastructure 
with the means to create an undisputable criminal 
network should be taken seriously.Investigating blockchain domains provides a unique 
challenge because there is no central WHOIS 
registration database tracking who registered the 
domain and when. Fortunately, some blockchain 
DNS providers like Emercoin have provided access 
to a block explorer tool,25 which enables a search for 
domain names, transaction hashes, and other values 
that might be stored in the blockchain. The Emercoin 
blockchain is pseudo-anonymous but can reveal 
some interesting information about a blockchain 
domain, such as IP addresses and transaction dates.

Countering blockchain domains might not be as 
difficult as you think
The weakness in blockchain domains is the need 
for third-party proxy services or browser plug-ins 
to resolve blockchain domains to an IP . Disabling or 
blocking the blockchain proxy resolution services 
and disabling browser plug-ins will disable the 
ability for blockchain domain resolution. Many threat

Adversarial 
machine learning
Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) 
technique that can be used in numerous applications, 
including cybersecurity. In responsible ML innovation, 
data scientists and developers build, train, and 
deploy ML models to understand, protect, and 
control data and processes to build trusted solutions.
However, adversaries can attack these ML-driven 
systems. The methods underpinning the production 
ML systems are systematically vulnerable to a new 
class of vulnerabilities across the ML supply chain 
collectively known as “adversarial ML.” Adversaries 
can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate AI 
systems and alter their behavior to serve a malicious 
end goal.
 The adversarial ML threat 
matrix  
Microsoft worked with MITRE to create the 
Adversarial ML Threat Matrix because we believe the 
first step in empowering security teams to defend 
against attacks on ML systems is to have a framework 
that systematically organizes the techniques 
employed by malicious adversaries in subverting 
ML systems. We hope that the security community 
can use the tabulated tactics and techniques to 
bolster their monitoring strategies around their 
organizations’ mission-critical ML systems.
1. Primary audience is security analysts: 
We think that securing ML systems is an 
infosec problem. The goal of the Adversarial 
ML Threat Matrix is to position attacks on 
ML systems in a framework where security 
analysts can orient themselves in these new 
and upcoming threats. The matrix is structured 
like the ATT&CK framework, owing to its 
wide adoption among the security analyst 
community. This way, security analysts have a 
familiar framework to learn about threats to 
ML systems, which are inherently different from 
traditional attacks on corporate networks.2. Grounded in real attacks on ML systems: 
We seeded this framework with a curated set 
of vulnerabilities and adversary behaviors 
that Microsoft and MITRE vetted to be 
effective against production ML systems, 
enabling security analysts to focus on realistic 
threats. We also incorporated learnings from 
Microsoft’s vast experience in this space into 
the framework. For instance, we found that 
model stealing is not the end goal of the 
attacker but in fact leads to more insidious 
model evasion. We also found that when 
attacking an ML system, attackers use a 
combination of traditional techniques like 
phishing and lateral movement alongside 
adversarial ML techniques.Intentional failure modes in ML 
Microsoft has incorporated AI- and ML-specific 
security practices into its Security Development 
Lifecycle (SDL) to protect Microsoft products and 
services against these attacks. In addition to threat 
detection and mitigation development work and 
automation, we have published guidance on steps 
customers can take to build defense in depth into 
their own AI and ML systems.
The centerpiece of the materials we’ve published is 
called Failure Modes in Machine Learning,26 which 
lays out the terminology we developed jointly with 
the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at 
Harvard University. It includes vocabulary that can 
be used to describe intentional failures caused by 
an adversary attempting to alter results or steal an 
algorithm, as well as vocabulary for unintentional 
failures such as a system that produces results that 
might be unsafe.

Attacks on ML models
Attack Description Example
Evasion attack Attacker modifies the 
query in a way that causes a model misclassification.Self-driving cars By manipulating a stop sign, or the environment observed by the car’s image recognition system, the adversary causes a model misclassification. In this way, a self-driving car could be made to ignore the stop sign. 
Poisoning attack Attacker contaminates the training phase of ML systems to get intended result. The attacker wants to misclassify specific examples to cause specific actions to be taken or omitted.Critical infrastructure systems
   
By submitting antivirus sof
tware as malware, 
an adversary can force its misclassification as malicious thereby eliminating the use of the antivirus software on client systems. This could leave critical infrastructure systems open to attack.
Membership InferenceAttacker can infer if a given data record was part of the model’s training dataset or not.Healthcare information
   
An adver
sary could look at a model trained on a 
body of data consisting of people with a specific surgical procedure. By knowing that a particular individual’s data was in the training set, an adversary would then know the individual had the surgical procedure. This privacy violation could then be leveraged publicly. 
Model Stealing Attacker is able to recover the model through carefully crafted queries.Finance algorithms
   
Through model queries, an adv
ersary could 
reconstruct the potential outputs of the ML model. This could be used to adversely affect proprietary algorithms designed for high frequency stock trading in a particular market.                        44TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Attacker evasions   
An evasion attack is an exploratory attack against 
an ML model to cause an integrity violation. From 
a system’s security perspective, it is instructive to 
consider black-box evasion attacks, in which an 
attacker may have no specific knowledge of the 
inner workings of the ML model but instead effects 
change by submitting inputs and observing the 
corresponding system output. This threat model 
is common to many AI systems hosted as a cloud 
service or on a consumer device, for example, and is 
a concern for models in finance, healthcare, defense, 
fraud, and security.Sophisticated black-box evasion attacks against 
ML models have been demonstrated repeatedly 
by white-hat researchers by using algorithms that 
iteratively determine what input will cause an 
integrity violation. Today, however, threat actors in 
the wild may also attempt evasion of ML systems 
in some domains, but usually do so through 
manual rather than algorithmic means and do not 
necessarily focus exclusively on ML as the evasion 
target. For example, content moderation filters are 
bypassed by mischievous or economically motivated 
users by obscuring payload content in creative 
ways. Security products that include antimalware or 
antiphishing models are evaded by adversaries using 
several obfuscation techniques. That these target 
systems rely on ML is not necessarily a consideration 
in these practical manual evasion attacks.
Whether or not an adversary is present in your 
business domain, the risk of adversaries evading 
an ML model exists in every domain. An ML model 
is an imperfect summary of a dataset, and as 
such, models have intrinsic failure modes even 
when trained on an ideal dataset. It is generally 
understood that the feasibility of evasion is a 
property of all ML models, rather than a failure 
mode to which only a few are susceptible to. These 
integrity violations may rarely be encountered 
during nominal use of the ML model but can be 
readily discovered by an adversary who is explicitly 
optimizing for the worst-case conditions necessary 
to cause them.ML model/data poisoning 
We are seeing a trend shift in adversarial ML 
security research. While in past years there was a 
focus on highly visible model evasion attacks where 
the fragility of some ML models could be easily 
demonstrated, the focus of security researchers 
is broadening to include less noticeable attacks. 
For example, in data poisoning attacks, the target 
is the training data that the ML models are built 
from. As new data is aggregated and incorporated 
into a dataset for training, it becomes increasingly 
important to validate that new training data has not 
been compromised. We have evidence of customer 
ML model compromise resulting from adversarial 
contamination of training data which, when left 
undetected, becomes an equally trusted part of 
existing training datasets. Without automation 
measuring for statistical drift in growing datasets, 
these types of attacks largely go undetected until an 
ML model has a critical failure.As we’ve seen with security research into past 
vulnerabilities,27 a pronounced uptick in research 
publications is soon followed by active exploitation. 
In anticipation of such a shift to focus on data 
poisoning attacks, Microsoft continues to focus 
on designing threat detections and mitigations 
to protect ML models and their datasets against 
these threats. Mitigations in this space can also be 
beneficial to detecting non-malicious training data 
drift, giving data scientists greater insight into the 
quality of their data over time and highlighting 
anomalies for investigation.
The risk of adversaries evading an 
ML model exists in every domain.

What we’re doing to stay ahead 
of the curve
Performing security assessments of production 
AI systems is not easy. Microsoft surveyed 28 
organizations,28 spanning Fortune 500 companies, 
governments, non-profits, and small and medium-
sized businesses, to understand the current 
processes in place to secure AI systems. We found 
that 25 out of 28 businesses indicated they don’t 
have the right tools in place to secure their AI 
systems and that security professionals are looking 
for specific guidance in this space.
To address the growing needs of adversarial ML, 
Microsoft released Counterfit, an open-source 
tool to help assess risk by allowing users to attack 
their own AI/ML. This tool was developed out of 
our own need to assess Microsoft’s AI systems for 
vulnerabilities and proactively secure AI services, 
in accordance with our responsible AI principles29 
and Responsible AI Strategy in Engineering (RAISE) 
initiative. Counterfit started as a corpus of attack 
scripts written specifically to target individual AI 
models and then grew into a generic automation 
tool to attack multiple AI systems at scale. Today, we 
routinely use Counterfit as part of our AI red team 
operations. 
 Based on learnings from internal and external 
engagements, Counterfit is designed to be flexible in 
three key ways:
1. Environment agnostic:  It can help assess AI 
models hosted in any cloud environment, on-
premises, or on the edge.
2. Model agnostic:  The tool abstracts the 
internal workings of AI models so that security 
professionals can focus on security assessment.
3. Strives to be data agnostic:  It works on AI 
models using text, images, or tabular input, 
and we continue to add data types.

Standards for addressing 
security of AI systems    
The prevalent use of AI and ML across industry 
sectors, an emerging regulatory landscape, and 
widespread mistrust or misunderstanding in the use 
of these technologies has led to an increased need 
for standards to define good practice and provide 
guidance to improve trust and market adoption. 
The International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) and the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) are developing AI standards,  
including defining key terminology and concepts 
for AI and ML, risk management, governance 
implications, data quality, and various topics related 
to trustworthiness. Also under development is a 
certifiable management system standard for AI, 
which will guide organizations to adopt a risk-based 
approach to responsibly use and develop AI systems 
as well as to demonstrate accountability and their 
duty of care toward stakeholders.AI and ML are increasingly integrated into all 
types of systems, including critical and safety 
infrastructure, resulting in new security threats 
unique to the use of AI systems and highly 
undesirable consequences of attacks. Such 
consequences can include the detrimental 
performance of a chatbot, denial of essential 
services, theft of intellectual property, or even 
physical danger to humans. In some instances, 
security attacks on AI systems have already caused 
significant issues. AI security cannot be considered in isolation of 
existing risk-based security, privacy, and governance 
foundations, which can address many of the 
threats that arise using AI systems. For example, 
using standards such as those for an information 
security management system (ISO/IEC 27001) and 
a privacy information management system (ISO/
IEC 27701) can help an organization to implement 
processes and controls to address security and 
privacy risks associated with its objectives and 
activities, including security threats to AI systems. 
In addition to these existing practices, this evolved 
threat landscape will require new guidance, good 
practices, and organizational and technical measures 
to help organizations protect their AI systems. 
Effective security measures are a vital component 
of responsible development and deployment of AI 
systems. Microsoft is engaged in new standards 
work that has been initiated to provide guidance for 
addressing security threats and failures in AI and ML.Learn more:

INTRODUCTION: A ttackers increase use of deception to  
pursue national objectives
JOHN LAMBERT, DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER AND VICE PRESIDENT, MICROSOFT  THREAT INTELLIGENCE CEN TER
The last year has been ma rked by significant historic geopolitical events and unforeseen challenges that have 
changed the way organizations approach da ily operations. During this time, nation state actors have largely 
maintained th eir operations at a consistent pace while creating new tactics and  techniques to eva de detection 
and increase the scale of their attacks.  
Major cybersecurity events, like the SolarWinds 
attacks by NOBELIUM and on-premises Exchange Server attacks by HAFNIUM, and attacks by multiple other actors have focused our collective attention on securing our supply chains. Nation state actors and many cybercrime operations have focused efforts on exposing security vulnerabilities among their suppliers or discovering unpatched systems that organizations relied on for continuity of business during this unusual year. These recent events have demonstrated the increasing importance in maintaining current security updates in all deployed systems as the most effective way to protect against rapidly evolving threats.
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center 
(MSTIC) and the Digital Security Unit (DSU) have observed that most nation state actors continue to focus operations and attacks on government agencies, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and think tanks for traditional espionage or surveillance objectives. The victims of attacks often have information relevant to an adversary government’s intelligence needs, which is why so many government agencies and think tanks are attacked. However, private industry’s role in supporting remote workers, increased healthcare services, COVID-19 vaccine research, and COVID-19 vaccine distribution have also made them more common targets for these sophisticated actors seeking information for their government’s national security or intelligence purposes. Our increased reliance on the global telecommunications backbone and virtual private network (VPN)/virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure for remote workers gave malicious actors new vectors to gain access to targeted private networks that were scrambling to support new ways of doing business.
NATION 
STATE ACTORS 
APPEAR TO BE INCREASING THE SCALE AND VOLUME OF ATTACKS TO EVADE DETECTION.
These sophisticated attackers continue to focus 
on effective techniques that help them maintain stealth and access. We have seen continuing attacks on traditional security hygiene elements as well as focus on developing and refining new, breakthrough attacks targeting the supplier ecosystem in order to attack downstream customers. Well-established spear phishing and password spray campaigns by nation state actors continue to be successful against organizations that have not yet implemented multifactor authentication (MFA) or other protections against this common tactic. However, as more organizations invest in securing their accounts, the success rate of these techniques will decline, and detection of the attacks will increase. In response, nation state actors appear to be increasing the scale and volume of these attacks to evade detection and improve the likelihood of success across multiple targets. This volume-oriented approach to                     
48 Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 202149compromising credentials will continue to be a 
useful technique if poorly secured accounts are 
available as targets. Attacks against unpatched 
third-party software or on-premises infrastructure 
will likely become more pervasive and become more 
easily exploited by nation state and cybercrime 
actors. Postponing installation of security updates 
or incomplete knowledge of deployed systems and 
their patch state will leave organizations vulnerable 
to sudden large-scale attacks as they scramble 
to identify affected assets and catch up to a fully 
patched state. Running networks with unsupported 
software, or software that is no longer updated, 
increases risk exponentially. Organizations must 
maintain comprehensive asset inventory, patch state 
awareness, and thorough backup and containment 
plans to be resilient against sophisticated attacks. 
Adversaries will continue to evolve new techniques 
to target and compromise corporate resources 
requiring a comprehensive “assume breach” 
mentality that extends beyond basic hygiene needs 
and MFA and into a holistic set of Zero Trust security 
principles. Applying a Zero Trust security model32 will 
become increasingly critical in protecting corporate 
identities, devices, applications, data, networks, and 
infrastructure against sophisticated threats.TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Looking forward, we know that adversarial 
governments will continue with their intelligence 
collection objectives, as well as explore the political 
boundaries of acceptable behavior in cyberspace. As 
a result, we expect nation state actors to continue refining their techniques by leveraging new exploits 
against security weaknesses and unpatched systems 
of common supply chain vendors in order to gain 
access to and collect information from downstream 
customers. Spear phishing and password spray 
attacks show no sign of slowing as the common 
method for reconnaissance and infiltration, 
increasing the importance of implementing end-to-
end MFA across accounts. The information Microsoft 
provides in this chapter captures much of the activity 
we have seen targeting our customers globally in 
the past year and captures the trends we anticipate 
nation state actors will continue to use in the next 
year. We recommend you use this information as a 
guide to understanding the tactics and techniques 
that these sophisticated actors may use to target 
your organizations so you can more effectively 
implement proactive defense.
Tracking nation 
state threats
Microsoft tracks nation state activities to protect 
our customers and our platforms and services. 
We use a variety of metrics and sophisticated 
data integration techniques to better understand 
targeting, motivations, and customer impact. MSTIC 
focuses on nation state actor activities because 
these tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) 
often have significant impact on our customers and are often unique, prompting deeper analysis and 
creation of customized detections. Understanding 
these TTPs also helps Microsoft better understand 
downstream actors such as cybercriminals and 
smaller nation states who often copy or reuse these 
methods. DSU focuses on the victims identified 
by MSTIC, connecting the victims of the attack to 
political objectives and stated intelligence goals 
of governments to help Microsoft provide fuller 
context to the world about why these nation state 
attacks occur.  
We focus on nation state activities regardless of 
platform, targeted victim, or geographical region, 
and we maintain visibility and active threat hunting 
worldwide to write better detections for our 
customers. We also analyze why nation state actors 
are pursuing particular victims, sectors, or regions. 
Putting it all together, the information presented 
here provides a snapshot of our defensive efforts 
on behalf of our affected customers. It is important 
to note that even if a particular industry sector 
or geographic region is not represented in the 
following information, nation state activity spans 
nearly every industry sector and geographic region. 
In other words, protections against these tactics are 
critical for every organization and individual. Our 
intelligence is impacted by the degree to which our 
products and platforms are utilized in a particular 
geography or sector. Nation state notifications
When a customer, whether it’s an organization 
or individual account holder, is targeted or 
compromised by nation state activities that 
Microsoft tracks, we deliver a nation state 
notification (NSN) to the customer. Over the past 
three years, Microsoft has delivered over 20,500 
NSNs. The charts and graphs in this chapter are 
derived from Microsoft’s NSN process.
Countering nation state activity
Nation state actors are generally well-resourced 
and capable adversaries. As noted above, they are 
often pursuing intelligence collection against targets 
of interest to their governments. Our relentless 
pursuit of these adversaries and our continuous 
development of new capabilities to detect and deter 
malicious activity supports our commitment to 
customer protection. We are constantly improving 
our capability to understand nation state actors 
and their victims to help bring better context and 
understanding to our customers.

1. Empowering customers
Microsoft leverages its NSN process to inform 
customers of targeting or compromise from 
nation state actors we track, providing actionable 
information for customers to rapidly respond and 
protect themselves. Microsoft also provides alerts 
to industry sectors and customer segments to help 
raise awareness of malicious activity and guidance 
on how to respond.2. Leveraging technology
Microsoft’s cumulative knowledge of the global 
threat landscape enables our products and services 
to constantly create and update new security 
product detections, helping to protect and defend 
against nation state activities at scale. These 
collective defenses represent the most effective 
method to counter nation state threats, as they 
are informed by the extensive threat intelligence 
resources built into each product and enabled by 
world-class engineering.
3. Taking technical action against malicious 
operations
From time to time, Microsoft will have sufficient 
information to warrant a one-time deletion or 
shutdown of infrastructure or assets associated with 
a nation state attacker. By taking proactive action 
against malicious infrastructure, the actor loses 
visibility, capability, and access across a range of 
assets previously under their control, forcing them 
to rebuild.4. Digital Crimes Unit
One of Microsoft’s unique resources in the fight 
against nation state actors is the Digital Crimes 
Unit (DCU). Using litigation to seize domains and 
assets used by nation state actors against Microsoft 
customers, the DCU has been instrumental in 
shutting down those attack vectors. These cases 
have led to the takedown of hundreds of domains 
and the protection of thousands of customers, and 
Microsoft remains one of the only companies willing 
to pursue legal action against nation state actors 
in order to seize infrastructure and disrupt attacks. 
Lessons learned from the cases are shared with 
Microsoft engineering teams to help improve our 
operational and technical disruption capabilities.
5. Informing public discourse and policy
Microsoft uses its voice to raise awareness about 
nation state activities, highlighting the context and 
impacts of the incidents and sharing context about 
attacks and why they matter to the world. This helps 
drive a broad discussion about what can be done 
to combat malicious nation state activities across 
government entities, NGOs, enterprises, academia, 
and the public. Talking publicly about nation state 
attacks is an important part of deterrence.Guide to the nation state actors 
discussed in this report 
Throughout this chapter, we cite examples of nation 
state actors to provide a deeper view into attack 
targets, techniques, and analysis of motivations. 
Microsoft identifies nation state activities by 
chemical element names, just some of which are 
shown in the following table together with the 
countries of origin from which the actors operate. 
This small sample of the total nation state actors 
tracked by Microsoft represents those that were 
most active in the last year and made most effective 
use of the tactics detailed in this chapter.
Microsoft also tracks and investigates many 
malicious activities that are either new or unknown 
in origin to develop a full understanding of the 
tactics, techniques, and objectives.
When we take proactive action against malicious 
infrastructure, the actor loses visibility, capability, 
and access across a range of assets previously 
under their control, forcing them to rebuild.                    51TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

What we're 
seeing 
Nation state targets
In the 2020 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, 
we identified common aims (espionage, 
disruption/destruction) and common techniques 
(reconnaissance, credential harvesting, malware, 
and virtual private network (VPN) exploits) prevalent 
among major nation state cyber actors. These 
aims and techniques were as prevalent this year 
as the year before. Tried-and-true methods such 
as large-scale spear-phishing campaigns were 
still valuable tools in the kits of hackers. However, 
attackers worldwide, either affiliated directly with 
governments or with more loose connections, are 
continuing to perform research against targets in 
order to be more convincing in an attack, develop 
new techniques that have not been seen before, 
or even mimic criminal behavior in an attempt to 
obfuscate intent and objective. Microsoft responds 
by also working to improve our ability to keep up 
with the changes.
Espionage more prevalent than destructive 
attacks
The two main goals of nation state actors have not 
changed either. In the last year, espionage, and 
more specifically, intelligence collection, has been 
a far more common goal than destructive attacks. Iran has been the only nation state actor willing 
to regularly engage in destructive attacks, mostly 
against Israel. These cyberattacks happened within 
a political environment in which both countries 
were trading blows just short of military strikes, 
including attacks on one another’s cargo ships. 
With tensions already so high, the decision to use 
cyber for destructive attacks was less of a strategic 
leap for Iran than it would have been for North 
Korea, Russia, or China. While nations other than 
Iran mostly refrained from destructive attacks, they 
did continue to compromise victims that would be 
prime candidates for destructive attacks if tensions 
increased to the point where governments made 
strategic decisions to escalate cyber warfare. 
The “Most targeted sectors” chart in this chapter 
section shows that nearly 80% of those targeted 
were either in government, NGOs, or think tanks. 
Think tanks often serve as policy incubators and 
implementers, with strong ties to current and former 
government officials and programs. Threat actors 
can and do exploit the connections between the 
more traditional NGO community and government 
organizations to position themselves to gain insights 
into national policy plans and intentions. As noted, 
it’s the think tanks with ideas relevant to current or 
future government policy or political objectives that 
put these organizations into the line of sight for 
intelligence operations. When traditional NGOs have 
similar information, we also see them as an objective 
for nation state actors. Nation state actors from North Korea added a 
third motive to their cyberattacks: monetary gain. 
North Korea targets companies in cryptocurrency 
trade or related research, likely seeking either to 
steal cryptocurrency or intellectual property. North 
Korea’s economy is never strong, but the COVID-19 
pandemic coming after years of UN sanctions has 
pushed it to its worst state in a generation, forcing 
North Korea to seek to find money by any means 
necessary. Although Iranian nation state actors 
frequently used ransomware attacks, Microsoft 
assesses that the ransomware was used more for 
covering the tracks of the attackers than for profit.
Targeting of IT companies is the big story of last year
A more revolutionary change, one common among 
all of the Big Four nation state cyber programs, has 
been the decision to target IT service providers 
in order to more successfully exploit victims 
downstream who receive services from those 
IT providers. The most glaring examples of the 
use of this kind of strategy from the last year are 
the Russian SolarWinds attacks and the Chinese 
exploitation of a vulnerability in on-premises 
Microsoft Exchange servers. These attacks are both 
covered in detail in the sections on Russia and 
China.Although SolarWinds and the Exchange vulnerability 
were the two main cybersecurity stories of the 
year, Iran and North Korea also used similar tactics 
of targeting IT providers to find creative ways to 
exploit their real targets. For example, North Korean 
actor ZINC created online personas of apparent 
cybersecurity experts, including websites and social 
media pages, and used these personas to approach 
experts in cybersecurity vulnerabilities in an attempt 
to get the researchers they corresponded with to 
open content that would have downloaded exploits 
onto their machines. While this was not a direct 
attack on an IT company like SolarWinds, it did 
represent an attempt to indirectly find avenues to 
compromise North Korea’s actual targets by going 
through the experts responsible for finding ways to 
protect them.

Most targeted countries (July 2020-June 2021)
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Organizations in the United States remained the target of most of the 
observed activity this year. We also noted targeting increases consistent with increasing geopolitical tensions between nations. Russia-based NOBELIUM raised the number of Ukrainian customers impacted from six last fiscal year to more than 1,200 this year by heavily targeting Ukrainian government interests involved in rallying support against a build-up of Russian troops along Ukraine’s border. This year marked a near quadrupling in targeting of Israeli entities, a result exclusively of Iranian actors, who focused on Israel as tensions sharply escalated between the adversaries.Mo st targeted sectors (July 2020-June 2021)
Ever y threat actor we tracked this year targeted entities within the 
government sector. NOBELIUM, NICKEL, THALLIUM, and PHOSPHORUS were the most active against this sector from the Big Four threat countries. Government sector targeting largely focused on ministries of foreign affairs and other global government entities involved in international affairs. (This chart excludes consumer accounts and depicts only enterprise targets’ corresponding sectors.)Co nsumer versus enterprise targets (July 2020-June 2021)
It is likely that thr eat actors thought consumer email accounts could 
be an easier way to gain access to targeted networks during the global move to remote work. Separate from enterprise targets and the industries they represented, consumer accounts received the second highest number of notifications this year. THALLIUM and PHOSPHORUS invested heavily in spear-phishing campaigns targeting these accounts.                    54TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Critical infrastructure versus noncritical infrastructure targets
From July 2020 to June 2021, critical infrastructures were not the focal 
point according to the NSN information that was tracked. China-based threat actors displayed the most interest and Russia-based threat actors 
accounted for the least in targeting entities in the critical infrastructure 
sector. Russian NOBELIUM’s cyber operations are a perfect example of displaying Russia’s interest in conducting operation for access and 
intelligence collection versus targeting a critical infrastructure for 
potential disruption operations.

Compromised versus targeted success rate
Success rates varied widely from threat group to threat group. Some 
groups, like North Korean THALLIUM, had a low success rate, because 
they used strategies like large-scale spear-phishing campaigns that 
rely more on using a wide net than a surgical strike. Password sprays 
are another example of a tactic with a low success rate, but where the 
attackers understand the success rate will be low. Other groups use very 
focused attacks that succeed much more often. HAFNIUM, for example, 
succeeded in 43% of its attacks. NICKEL succeeded at an astonishing 
rate of over 90%. The figures below represent an average of different 
tactics that are designed to succeed at different rates. The first quarter 
was extremely high, not necessarily because actors were more successful 
that quarter, but because Microsoft noted less activity stemming from 
low-success-rate attacks. 
Compromise rate (July 2020-June 2021)
Activity origins
The following section depicts the frequency of attacks by country of 
origin, measured in the number of NSNs generated from attacks by 
each actor. Russia-based threat activity dominated this year, driven 
by NOBELIUM’s large-scale targeting. North Korea–based actors also 
employed a strategy of ubiquitous targeting that earned North Korea 
the second highest percentage of notifications.
Country of activity origin
NOBELIUM, and its aggressive targeting of IT service providers and 
Western government institutions, catapulted Russia to the top spot for 
countries where attacks originated this year. That group was responsible 
for 92% of the notifications to customers about Russia-based threat 
activity. The outsized proportion of attacks coming from North Korea is 
a result of the strategy taken by threat actors THALLIUM and CERIUM. 
These groups rely on large quantities of attacks. While these attacks 
have a low percentage of success, because of the high number of 
attempts, the groups still manage to successfully infect some victims.
Attacks by country of origin (July 2020-June 2021)
Most active nation state activity groups
Like the “compromised versus targeted” section above, the data in this 
section is heavily affected by the tactics chosen by the attackers. If one 
group attempts a password spray attack on a hundred targets and 
successfully compromises one, while another group surgically focuses 
on only one victim that it compromises, they have both had the same 
number of successes. However, the first group will appear as the more 
“active” group, because it has attacked a hundred targets. The top three 
groups in this list all make use of high-fail-rate tactics. NOBELIUM, in 
addition to high-success-rate-focused attacks, also makes frequent use 
of low-success password sprays, while THALLIUM and PHOSPHORUS 
send spear-phishing emails to large groups. This chart, then, does not 
necessarily equate to the most dangerous groups, although it does say 
something about their relative levels of persistence and ubiquity.

Nation state attacker tools 
The tools used by nation states to compromise 
victim networks are most frequently the same 
tools used by other malicious actors. To achieve 
their objectives, nation state actors may create 
or leverage bespoke malware, construct novel 
password spray infrastructure, or craft unique 
phishing or social engineering campaigns. However, 
actors like GADOLINIUM are also increasingly 
turning to use open-source tools33 or common 
malware to impact a supply chain, attempt a man-
in-the-middle attack, or launch a denial-of-service 
attack. These methods allow malicious actors to 
obfuscate their actions by hiding in plain sight. 
Increased use of open-source tools provides some 
advantages for security professionals responsible 
for detecting and defending against these attacks. 
Increasingly, the same security and computer 
hygiene routines that protect from ordinary threats 
also help protect from nation states. Training 
employees to be skeptical can go a long way to 
stopping spear-phishing attacks and thwarting the 
common methods that Microsoft sees in the early 
stages of a compromise.It is often the case that nation state actors develop 
and refine new attack techniques and that criminals 
adopt and further refine them over time. Microsoft 
expects tools designed to target and compromise IT 
supply chains to enter the mainstream and become 
more common, making concepts like Zero Trust 
architecture a priority from software development 
through deployment and updating . Well-funded 
nation state actors will continue to create unique 
tools to achieve their objectives, but just like any 
other streamlined organization, are just as likely 
to use common tools where they can to improve 
efficiency and effectiveness.

Analysis of 
nation state activity  this year  
Evolving nation state cybersecurity threats have 
produced a watershed year with an increased 
focus on on-premises servers and the exposure of 
widespread supply chain vulnerabilities, most acutely in software. The scope, sophistication, and success 
of HAFNIUM’s 0-day exploits for on-premises 
Exchange servers in early 2021 and NOBELIUM’s 
compromise of SolarWinds’ network management 
software in late 2020 caught the world’s attention, 
although the nation state threat extended beyond 
those immediate incidents. For one, Russia-based 
NOBELIUM and China-based HAFNIUM’s targeting 
of on-premises resources and dumping credentials 
in those operations would have allowed them the 
opportunity to seize credentials to access and pivot 
to cloud-based resources. Russia-linked STRONTIUM also developed target-specific capabilities for 
on-premises infrastructure of foreign and defense-
related entities in Europe, marking a shift from the 
predominant cloud-first, cloud-only operations the 
group was known for in 2019 and 2020. Multiple 
Iranian actors also likely conducted supply chain 
operations, including one in early 2020 that likely 
sought intelligence from government agencies 
indirectly through IT and engineering services 
companies that support US defense and intelligence 
agencies.Russia
Over the past year, Russia-based activity groups have 
solidified their position as acute threats to the global 
digital ecosystem by demonstrating adaptability, 
persistence, a willingness to exploit trusted technical 
relationships, and a facility with anonymization and 
open-source tools that make them increasingly 
difficult to detect and attribute. They have also 
shown a high tolerance for collateral damage, which 
leaves anyone with connections to targets of interest 
vulnerable to opportunistic targeting.

Abusing supply chain and other trusted technical 
relationships
Russia-based NOBELIUM proved how insidious 
and devastating software supply chain attacks can 
be with its compromise of the SolarWinds Orion 
software update. Although the group limited follow-
on exploitation to roughly 100 organizations, its 
malicious backdoor malware was pushed to roughly 
18,000 entities worldwide, leaving those impacted 
customers vulnerable to further attack. 
NOBELIUM’s operational techniques were much 
more diverse than just the malicious backdoor 
and ranged from password spray and phishing to 
compromise of third-party providers to facilitate 
future attacks. The actor targeted cloud solution 
providers (CSPs) and leveraged the backdoor to steal 
a Mimecast private key. NOBELIUM went on to target 
downstream customers by masquerading as those 
CSPs and as the legitimate Mimecast app.34 In May, 
the group compromised a US government agency’s 
account at a popular email marketing service, 
cloaking malicious components behind the service’s 
legitimate URL to send a phishing email to more 
than 150 diplomatic, international development, and 
nonprofit organizations mostly in the United States 
and across Europe.35 
Comparing the distribution of NOBELIUM victims 
identified in the first few months after discovery of the SolarWinds compromise and the targeting 
picture of NOBELIUM’s activity through June 2021 
highlights the tactical shifts and multi-vectored 
approach the threat group employs to gain access to 
desired systems. The first chart depicts victims that 
were subject to high-touch threat actor exploitation 
that in some cases leveraged the supply chain 
backdoor access. The second chart reflects the mass 
spear-phishing and password spray campaigns the 
actor used against targeted organizations in the first 
half of 2021. We can see NOBELIUM consistently 
targeted the government, NGO, IT services, and 
professional services sectors (included in “Other” 
in the latter chart), but the volume of compromise 
attempts fluctuated in line with the tactical changes.
Using a range of techniques to evade detection and attribution
Russian actors demonstrated varying degrees of 
adaptability and security consciousness that helped 
them evade attribution and network defenses. 
NOBELIUM showed a deep knowledge of common 
software tools, network security systems, and cloud 
technologies, as well as remediation methods 
incident response teams use, and they changed their 
operations accordingly to maintain persistence.36 
Responder surveillance was a tactic employed by 
another Russian threat group, YTTRIUM, in the 
past.37 In summer and fall 2020, STRONTIUM deployed an 
automated password spray/brute forcing tool that 
ran through more than a thousand anonymized Tor 
IPs,38 making it large scale and hard to detect and 
attribute. The tool was deployed multiple times 
against more than 40 political organizations and 
advocacy groups based in the United States and the 
UK in the run-up to, and immediately after, the US 
presidential election.NOBELIUM targets by industries/verticals

Achieving higher rates of compromise and 
targeting more government organizations
Over the past year, Russia-based groups have 
improved their rates of successful compromise and 
increasingly set their sights on government targets, a 
confluence of trends that could portend more high-
impact compromises in the year ahead. Year-on-year 
comparisons of NSN data depict a marked increase 
in successful compromises, from 21% successful 
between July 2019 and June 2020 to 32% since July 
2020. The percentage of government organizations 
among Russian targets exploded from roughly 3% 
last period to 53% since July 2020.
Russian threat actors will follow targets wherever 
they are, be it in the cloud or on-premises. This past 
year, STRONTIUM pivoted to more on-premises 
targeting, developing target-specific capabilities 
against on-premises infrastructure of foreign policy 
and defense-related entities in Europe. This strategy 
was a change from the predominant cloud-first, 59cloud-only operations the group was known for 
throughout 2019 and into 2020.TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
For the first time since August 2018, government 
organizations were the most targeted sector for 
Russian threat actors Microsoft tracks, followed by 
think tanks. The government organizations were 
largely involved in foreign policy and national 
security or defense, although threat actor BROMINE 
concentrated its efforts against US state, county, 
and city governments, as well as aviation and port authorities. The healthcare industry was the 
third most targeted sector this period, fueled by 
STRONTIUM’s credential harvesting attempts against 
organizations developing and testing COVID-19 
vaccines and treatments40 in the United States, 
Australia, Canada, Israel, India, and Japan through 
summer 2020.
What lessons might NOBELIUM have 
learned from the SolarWinds incident? 
1. The US Government is still not sure where the red lines are for cyber operations. 
As a sign of the ongoing debate within US and European policy communities about whether 
and how to respond to the SolarWinds breach, in March a former senior adviser to Britain’s 
Government Communications Headquarters cautioned the Biden administration not to react 
too harshly to Russia’s “surgical” espionage campaign.39 Russian threat actors have exploited 
this policy ambiguity for years and could continue to do so for years to come. 
2. The private sector is critical to the defense of US government networks. 
Microsoft and FireEye were the public face of incident response during the SolarWinds 
attack. In the future, NOBELIUM and other groups could move early to handicap high-
profile cybersecurity teams, anticipating that doing so will slow the time to identification and 
remediation of intrusions against high-value targets.Seeking intelligence on the United States and 
Europe
Russian threat actors attempted to access accounts at organizations on almost every continent this 
period, but they predominantly focused on 
organizations based in the United States, followed 
by Ukraine, UK, and NATO allies and member states 
across Europe. On May 14, the Russian government 
officially named the United States and Czechia 
“unfriendly” countries, while Poland, Lithuania, 
Latvia, Estonia, UK, Canada, Ukraine, and Australia 
appeared on a preliminary list leaked in April.41 
The top three countries most impacted by Russian 
cyber activity this past year—United States, Ukraine, and UK—were on the “unfriendly countries” lists. 
Microsoft’s observations of Russian threat activity 
this past year suggest that intelligence collection 
was a primary motivation, as we saw data exfiltration 
but little evidence of disruptive or destructive activity 
from the groups we track. Gaining information on 
the policy plans and intentions of those perceived 
as adversaries would be standard intelligence 
requirements for the Russian government agencies 
to whom the US government attributes much of this 
activity.42

China
Over the past year, Microsoft observed Chinese 
nation state threat actors target the US political 
landscape for insight into policy shifts and target 
government entities that enact foreign policies 
in Europe and Latin American countries likely for 
intelligence collection. To accomplish their mission, 
several China-based threat actors exploited a range 
of previously unidentified vulnerabilities for different 
services and network components.The following charts illustrate activity by China-
based threat groups in July 2020–June 2021 
based on NSNs issued to customers. These charts

activities observed.
HAFNIUM and the Exchange vulnerabilities  
In early March 2021, Microsoft blogged about 
HAFNIUM for the first time related to the detection 
of multiple 0-day exploits being used to attack on-
premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.43 HAFNIUM, a group assessed to be state sponsored 
and operating out of China, based on observed 
victimology, tactics, and procedures, primarily 
targets entities in the United States across a number 
of industry sectors, including infectious disease 
researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, 
defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs. 
HAFNIUM has previously compromised victims by 
exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers 
and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, 
like Covenant, for command and control. Once they’ve gained access to a victim network, 
HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing 
sites like MEGA. In campaigns unrelated to these 
vulnerabilities, Microsoft has observed HAFNIUM 
interacting with victim Office 365 tenants. While they 
are often unsuccessful in compromising customer 
accounts, this reconnaissance activity helps the 
adversary identify more details about their targets’ 
environments. HAFNIUM operates primarily from 
leased virtual private servers in the United States.

China: Top five targeted industries/sectors 
(July 2020-June 2021)

were government entities worldwide. The targeting of 
three countries’ government entities accounted for half of the NSNs issued and 23 countries accounted for the remaining half.Chi

are an advance persistent threat, if they are tasked to target an entity for intelligence collection, they will find another vulnerability to leverage to gain access.HAF
 NIUM: Top targeted industries/verticals 
(Prior to the increase in Exchange Server exploitation)
HAFNIUM used these vulnerabilities to access on-
premises Exchange servers, which enabled access to email accounts and allowed installation of additional malware to facilitate long-term access to victim environments. MSTIC attributes this campaign with high confidence to HAFNIUM. The vulnerabilities exploited were CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065.
The attacks included three steps. First, HAFNIUM 
would gain access to an Exchange Server either with stolen passwords or by exploiting the aforementioned vulnerabilities to gain initial access. Second, they deployed web shells on the compromised server. Web shells potentially allow attackers to steal data and perform additional malicious actions that lead to further compromise. Third, they used that remote access, which was typically run from the US-based private servers to exfiltrate data from an organization’s network. Microsoft assesses HAFNIUM was associated with the initial activity with the 0-day exploits; however, after the vulnerability announcement, several nation state actors and criminal groups maneuvered quickly to take advantage of the vulnerabilities for their own gain.
CVE Description  
CVE-2021-26855 Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange, which allowed the 
attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.
CVE-2021-26857 An insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service.
CVE-2021-26858 A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange.

On July 19, 2021, the US government with its allies 
and partners took a stance against the Chinese 
government and issued a statement that China’s 
malicious cyber operation poses a major threat 
to the United States and its allies’ economic and 
national security.44 Although slim on the technical 
details, the same statement attributed HAFNIUM 
with a high level of confidence to cyber actors 
affiliated with China’s civilian intelligence agency, the 
Ministry of State Security. These actors compromised 
tens of thousands of computers and networks 
worldwide in a massive cyber espionage campaign 
that mostly impacted private sector victims. 
More 0-days and other exploitation of 
vulnerabilities
In July, SolarWinds released a security advisory 
for CVE-2021-35211, crediting Microsoft with the 
notification.45 Microsoft detected the 0-day remote 
code execution exploit being used to exploit the 
SolarWinds Serv-U FTP software at entities in the 
US Defense Industrial Base Sector and software 
companies. This activity is attributed to a group 
operating out of China, based on observed 
victimology, tactics, and procedures.In April 2021, FireEye released a blog and credited 
MSTIC for their contribution in identifying a Pulse 
Secure VPN 0-day exploit that was leveraged by 
Chinese nation state threat actors.46 Microsoft 
associates some of the activity with MANGANESE 
and NICKEL. The Department of Homeland Security 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) released an alert on the same 0-day activity 
indicating that it affected US government agencies, 
critical infrastructure entities, and other private 
sector organizations likely beginning in June 2020.47 
CISA stated that after the successful exploitation, 
the threat actor used their access to place web shells 
on the Pulse Connect Secure appliance for further 
access and persistence.
 
In addition to MANGANESE, MSTIC has observed 
ZIRCONIUM and two other threat actors who 
exploited small office or home office routers 
worldwide. These threat actors are likely 
compromising routers to use as infrastructure 
for their computer network operations. These 
compromised routers are likely in the same 
geographical area as their intended target to 
obscure scrutiny against the associated activity.A worldwide intelligence collection operation 
After the September 2020 Microsoft blog on 
multiple nation state threat actors targeting 
information on US elections, ZIRCONIUM did 
not stop their collection operations.48 As the US 
presidential election day approached, ZIRCONIUM 
continued to employ web-bugged emails, targeting 
individuals with access to knowledge of potential 
shifts in US policy. On July 19, 2021, the United 
Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre released 
a statement that attributed APT31, which is roughly 
tracked as ZIRCONIUM by Microsoft, to the Ministry 
of State Security—China’s civilian intelligence 
agency.49
Chinese nation state cyber operations did not 
overlook their neighbors. Since July 2020, activity 
tied to CHROMIUM targeted entities in India, 
Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Thailand and 
the sensitive social, economic, and political 
issues surrounding Hong Kong and Taiwan. From 
Microsoft’s perspective, CHROMIUM activity was 
most active against universities in Hong Kong 
and Taiwan, followed by government entities and 
telecommunication providers in the other countries. 
In addition to targeting neighboring countries, 
there has been a steady drumbeat of intelligence collection against Latin American countries and 
in Europe. Besides leveraging exploits for VPN 
devices in their cyber operations, NICKEL’s activity 
also targeted government foreign ministries 
throughout Central and South American countries 
and some European countries. As China’s influence 
continues to shift in the region and with countries 
that are partners in their Belt and Road Initiative, 
we assess that Chinese threat actors will continue 
to target entities to gain insight into investments, 
negotiations, and influence.

Iran
Iran continued its streak of destructive cyberattacks 
against regional adversaries while taking a “wait-
and-see” approach with the United States amid the 
prospects for sanctions relief from nuclear talks after 
US elections.Focused on Israel with new attack tools amid 
broader escalation
As a covert war between Iran and Israel escalated, 
Iranian offensive cyber actors increased their 
attention to Israel and brought with them Iran’s 
newest tool of choice—ransomware. Iran also 
conducted ransomware attacks against at least 
one Gulf State adversary.50 While it remains unclear 
whether Iranian actors are using ransomware for 
financial gain, in at least one case they used it as a 
cover for a destructive attack by deploying wiper 
malware on a company’s network while demanding 
a ransom.51 Microsoft detected an increased focus from a 
growing number of Iranian groups targeting Israeli 
entities since November, and with that focus came 
a string of ransomware attacks. An Iran-linked 
threat actor that we track as RUBIDIUM probably 
conducted the Pay2Key and N3tw0rm ransomware 
campaigns that almost exclusively targeted Israel in 
late 2020 and early 2021, respectively. One common 
element of RUBIDIUM’s ransomware campaigns was 
its targeting of Israeli logistics companies involved in 
maritime transportation. These targets indicate a link 
to Tehran’s broader objective of retaliating against 
Israeli pressure.52A wait-and-see approach toward the United States likely serves two purposes
Despite Tehran’s less aggressive approach toward 
the United States, relative to its regional adversaries, 
US entities remained Iranian threat actors’ top target, 
comprising nearly half of the NSNs we delivered to 
cloud-service customers. Iranian cyber operations 
toward US targets consisted of a two-pronged 
approach: acquiring strategic intelligence likely to 
gain insights into US policy views and planning and 
acquiring a foothold on networks likely to provide 
Tehran with contingency options in case the United 
States failed to provide sufficient sanctions relief.

In late 2020, PHOSPHORUS began targeting nuclear 
policy experts in signatory nations of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, very likely for intelligence to gain an edge in anticipated talks on the accord following President Biden’s election. PHOSPHORUS conducted a credential phishing campaign by masquerading as fellow foreign and nuclear policy experts and sending links to nuclear-themed articles that directed victims to a credential harvesting site. They targeted fewer than 25 senior personnel at medical research organizations, as detailed by Proofpoint,
53 but the vast majority of the 
100-plus targets we detected were nuclear policy or conflict resolutions experts—in line with the theme of the phishing emails—in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Russia. PHOSPHORUS honed its targeting on this community as nuclear talks began in Vienna in April, including targeting diplomat participants.Previously in 2020, PHOSPHORUS masqueraded as conference organizers to high-profile international conferences, as we detailed in this blog.
54 At 
Microsoft, we detected PHOSPHORUS sending spoofed email invitations with links to credential harvesting sites to more than 100 policy experts who were prospective attendees, several of whom they compromised. The group’s credential phishing campaign likely sought to acquire intelligence to better position itself in international engagement.
    
Since April 2021, select Iranian actors also tar
geted 
US agriculture and media companies that are unlikely intelligence targets for Tehran.
55 These 
same operators employed ransomware on other companies, suggesting a potential aim to gain a foothold for contingency plans in case nuclear talks fail to meet Tehran’s expectations.
In some cases, the Iranian targeting of US entities 
that we have detected could be focused on intelligence collection, contingency planning, or both. Early this year, CURIUM conducted a spear-phishing campaign targeting companies that provide IT and engineering services for US defense and intelligence agencies, probably as a part of a supply chain operation to gain access to their customers.Iran: Most targeted countries (July 2020–June 2021)

North Korea 
In the last year, North Korean threat actors have 
been extremely active relative to the country’s 
size and resources, compared to the other major 
attacking states. For example, in the last three 
months of 2020, just over half the NSNs Microsoft 
issued were for North Korean state actors, in spite 
of North Korea being the smallest of the four most 
prolific nation state actors Microsoft tracks.Feeding a vast appetite for intelligence
The vast majority of the North Korean targeting 
Microsoft noted was directed at consumer account 
targets. For the most part, these targets were 
probably selected based on the likelihood they could 
help North Korea obtain non-publicly available 
diplomatic or geopolitical intelligence. North 
Korean groups THALLIUM and ZINC continued to 
create much of the targeting Microsoft observed, 
but they were joined by other groups, such as 
OSMIUM and CERIUM. Together, these groups 
focused on diplomatic officials, academics, and 
think tank members from around the world. Most of those targeted were in three countries: South 
Korea, the United States, and Japan. However, North 
Korean actors also targeted academics and think 
tank officials in Europe and even China and Russia, 
countries generally seen as friendly to North Korea.
The focus on diplomatic or geopolitical intelligence 
likely was driven by Pyongyang’s anxiety for 
information in a volatile international situation. 
Diplomatic targeting was particularly heavy during 
and directly after the US election. North Korea’s 
strong interest in intelligence collection probably 
had several key questions it sought to answer: Will the international community continue to strictly 
enforce sanctions on North Korea? How does 
COVID-19 change international dynamics? What will 
the new US administration’s policy be toward North 
Korea, and how will the tripartite US-South Korea-
Japan partnership pursue that policy together?

COVID-19 also drove another North Korean focus 
in the last year: the targeting of pharmaceutical 
companies. As Microsoft reported in November 
2020,56 ZINC and CERIUM targeted pharmaceutical 
companies and vaccine researchers in several 
countries, probably to speed up its own vaccine 
research or to gain intelligence on the state of 
research in the rest of the world.

Finally, North Korea also used social engineering in 
ways not seen from it before. As MSTIC reported 
in concert with Google in January,57  ZINC targeted 
security researchers with a fairly sophisticated social 
engineering campaign. The campaign included 
spending months setting up fake profiles that 
looked like real security companies and researchers, 
with websites and social media platforms to support 
these personas. This targeting sought long-term 
effects beyond the immediate attack. It also 
showed that North Korea is more than capable of 
understanding the Western security landscape well 
enough to blend into it.

Vietnam
Vietnamese threat group BISMUTH utilized cryptocurrency miners to target private sector and government 
institutions in France and Vietnam. Because cryptocurrency miners tend to be seen as lower-priority threats by 
security systems, BISMUTH was able to take advantage of the smaller alert profile caused by their malware to slip 
into systems unnoticed.  As MSTIC reported in November 2020,58 BISMUTH carefully planned attacks, conducting reconnaissance before 
creating uniquely crafted spear-phishing emails for each individual. Sometimes, BISMUTH actors, similar to 
PHOSPHORUS operators, would correspond with targets to build rapport before sending the email containing 
a malicious attachment. Once it compromised networks, BISMUTH sought to achieve continuous monitoring. Its

Private sector 
offensive actors   
A growing industry of companies called private 
sector offensive actors (PSOAs) create and sell 
malicious cyber technologies that enable their 
customers to break into people’s computers, phones, 
and internet-connected devices. These private 
companies may not be nation state actors, but their 
business model presents a dangerous and rapidly 
growing challenge for organizations, companies, 
and individual consumers. These tools also threaten 
many global human rights efforts, as they have been 
observed targeting and surveilling dissidents, human 
rights defenders, journalists, civil society advocates, 
and other private citizens. 
In December 2020, Microsoft’s efforts to protect 
our customers from the threats presented by this 
technology led us to file an amicus brief in support 
of WhatsApp’s case against Israel-based NSO 
Group Technologies (NSO Group) along with Cisco, 
GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, VMware, and Internet 
Association.59  The brief encouraged the court to 
reject NSO Group’s position that it is not responsible 
for the use of its surveillance and espionage 
products by governments. Microsoft also worked 
with Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto’s Munk 
School, to disable malware being used by an Israel-based PSOA that Microsoft calls SOURGUM, and 
that Citizen Lab identified as Candiru.60 SOURGUM 
created malware and 0-day exploits (fixed in CVE-
2021-3197961 and CVE-2021-3377162) as a part of a 
hacking-as-a-service package sold to government 
agencies and other malicious actors. The malware 
was used to target more than 100 victims around 
the world including politicians, human rights 
activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, 
and political dissidents. To limit these attacks, 
Microsoft has created and built protections into our 
products against this unique malware, which we 
call DevilsTongue.63 By examining how SOURGUM’s 
customers were delivering DevilsTongue to victim 
computers, we saw they were doing so through a 
chain of exploits that impacted popular browsers 
and our Windows operating system. We published 
details of the malware and 0-day exploits so that 
the world can better understand SOURGUM’s 
activity and address and mitigate the threat.  Private 
companies should remain subject to liability when 
they use their cyber-surveillance tools to break the 
law, or knowingly permit their use for such purposes, 
regardless of who their customers are or what 
they are trying to achieve. Microsoft will continue 
to identify, track, and protect our customers and 
global digital ecosystem from the indiscriminate 
attacks caused by PSOA technology and pursue 
other methods to disrupt this growing threat to our 
customers.Comprehensive protections required   
Nation state actors have demonstrated that they 
will go to great lengths to accomplish a mission 
to collect information or intelligence. The skill and 
persistence of malicious nation state actors increase 
the difficulty of detecting and protecting against 
advanced threats. Their impact can be wide ranging 
and highly damaging. These adversaries are well-
funded, employ techniques of tremendous breadth 
and sophistication, and are motivated by objectives 
of national significance—which may lead to their 
compromising networks for unexpected purposes. 
More than other adversaries, nation state attackers 
target individuals specifically for access to their 
connections, communications, and information. At 
the conclusion of an operation, they will assess what 
went well and what did not and refine tactics and 
techniques for more successful future missions.  Therefore, defense-in-depth strategies against 
nation state adversaries should include educating 
employees on how to avoid being targeted 
themselves. Applying Zero Trust principles  across 
corporate resources helps more effectively adapt to 
the complexity of the modern environment, embrace 
the mobile workforce, and protect people, devices, 
applications, and data no matter where they are 
located or the scale of threats they face.
While nation state attacks are often sophisticated 
or can deploy 0-day vulnerabilities to gain access to 
networks, defense-in-depth strategies and proactive 
monitoring can greatly reduce the actor’s dwell 
time on a network, potentially enabling disruption 
of their activities before they reach their goals. 
Above and beyond enabling foundational basics 
like MFA, IT departments should prioritize steps to 
mitigate lateral movement by attackers; specifically, 
credential hygiene and network segmentation. To 
limit the damage of data exfiltration, information 
rights management can be applied to files. Building 
protective controls across your managed identities, 
devices, applications, data, infrastructure, and 
networks will raise the threshold for attackers, 
improving your organization’s ability to detect 
anomalous activity in the environment.

INTRODUCTION:  Innovation-driven opportunity in an 
exponentially larger attack landscape
MICHAL BRAVERMAN -BLUMENSTYK, CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, CLOUD AND AI SECURITY
In the past year, we have observed an abundance of incidents driving both physical and digital disruption of 
operations for many organizations. These incidents preyed at times on the physical realm, such as disruption of 
production lines and energy substations, and in other cases, they were conducted entirely in the digital realm, 
such as via a ransomware campaign. 
Looking at the attack surfaces that were exploited 
provides an additional perspective: from legacy 
operational technology (OT) equipment to brand 
new Internet of Things (IoT) devices; from seemingly 
ordinary cloud-migration projects to 5G IoT-related 
endeavors; and from physical supply chain to digital 
supply chain. All of these are playing an increasing role 
as fertile attack surfaces. These are all topics we will 
elaborate on in this chapter. 
Supply chain integrity 
Supply chains, both physical and digital, have an 
explicit reliance on trust, and adversaries have taken 
notice. Over the last decade, successful organizations 
have been able to meet the demands of scale, 
efficiency, and speed by building expansive, and often 
complex, ecosystems to deliver value to stakeholders. 
Security adversaries today view these systems as targets for exploitation, as witnessed recently in 
the highly visible and impactful SolarWinds and 
Kaseya attacks. While threats and attacks continue to 
intensify, supply chain complexity increases the costs 
of defending and the likelihood that an exposure can 
produce a significant return for an adversary.
IoT Security
IoT security is a geometrically expanding frontier with 
innovation-driven opportunity and an exponentially 
larger attack landscape. The adoption of IoT and the 
huge acceleration in remote services, both at home 
and in the workplace since the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic, increases the likelihood of risk materializing. 
This is a trend that will continue as technologies like 
5G and innovative IoT applications become more 
ubiquitous. OT Security
OT devices, such as industrial control, hospital 
monitoring, or water management systems, represent 
the public infrastructure that many societies have 
come to depend on for decades. Many are lagging 
in adopting and leveraging modern security 
standards. As evidenced by recent attacks on water, 
transportation, and energy utilities, disruption in these 
areas have profound and broad impact 
The chapter includes discussions about how 
organizations can understand and improve their IoT, 
OT, and supply chain security posture. We share in 
these discussions our data-driven perspectives related 
to the IoT and OT threat landscape, research findings 
by the Azure Defender for IoT team, global initiatives 
such as the Global Cyber Alliance, and more.

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Challenges in managing risk 
associated with the supplier 
ecosystem
As outsourcing for applications, infrastructure, devices, and human capital expands, the adoption of tools to 
monitor multiple tiers of suppliers for quality, security, integrity, and resilience risks is also growing, and the 
plethora of frameworks and approaches that organizations are leveraging today continues to grow in tandem. 
Additional complexity emerges when frameworks are applied inconsistently within an organization and across 
suppliers, or if multiple frameworks are in play.
When it comes to risk assessment and management, siloes can create additional problems. Different teams 
have different priorities, which can lead to completely different risk appetites, priorities, practices, and cultures. 
This inconsistency can be inefficient and create a duplication of effort, gaps in risk analysis, and an inability to 
effectively share risk information across the organization.
An always-on, automated, integrated approach 
is needed,  but current processes aren’t well-suited 
to evolve:
•Supplier assessment and review processes often 
include just a questionnaire.
•Once a supplier is onboar ded, there is only a 
point-in-time annual review cy cle.
• Often, different teams within the same company 
have different processes and functions and no 
clear way to share information across teams. 
This can make it difficult to create a holistic and 
automated view of organizational risk. Siloed environments pose challenges to risk 
assessment and management
What we’re hearing 
Recently, the Microsoft M365 Security, Compliance, and Management team hosted an event to discuss 
the challenges and strategic needs of CxOs (CISOs, CIOs, VPs/Heads of IT and Governance, and 
others) and their organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their security and risk management 
experiences.  These are some of the takeaways: 
1. The selection and management of suppliers is shaped by a host of factors leading to lack of 
clarity and low trust, as many struggle to know their environment. 
Organizations must balance protecting themselves from human liability, issues inherent with hybrid 
work, shadow IT (unknown or unmanaged apps, services, and infrastructure developed and managed 
outside standard policies), diversity of their digital estate, and evolving threats and vulnerabilities. 
Adding complexity, there are usually several parties weighing in on vendor/supplier selection. Security 
is just one of the factors considered and often not a top priority, even though it is an area that needs 
immediate attention. Organizations end up with long lists of suppliers that must be managed (some 
of them unknown), often with a limited look into their security practices and posture. Add to this that 
working within the confines of a supplier contract often limits the assessments. As a result, it is difficult 
to have desired visibility and trust in suppliers. 
2. Proactive management of a supplier ecosystem is ideal, but difficult. Designated critical 
suppliers require focus due to the potential risk they pose. 
Organizations are often forced into a split approach to supplier management—proactive, when 
possible, but typically more reactive. Reactive approaches are a result of limited resources and projects 
scoped without security as a consideration.  To ensure their protection is as comprehensive as possible, 
organizations keep critical suppliers (those critical to an organization’s mission) on a shorter leash, with 
less flexibility and more oversight.                            73
3. Leaders are devoting more resources to supplier security, but recent breaches demonstrated 
that traditional models couldn’t guarantee safety.  
IT teams are appreciative of the influx of budget and resources following the SolarWinds and Colonial 
Pipeline breaches. That appreciation comes with an equal amount of trepidation. Those breaches 
demonstrated that the very strategies they are implementing likely would not protect them from a 
similar attack, and continuous assessments and push for remediation across tiers of suppliers are 
necessary. 
4. Greater visibility and unique solutions are top requests to managing suppliers.  
Within the four key pillars of digital estates—identities, applications, infrastructure, and devices—
suppliers’ personnel are a top concern. Across that risk hierarchy, organizations are looking for 
suppliers to provide:
•Greater visibility into security and who ultimately has access to the organization’s data.
•Customized solutions  demonstrating a working knowledge of the industry and the company-
specific needs.TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Zero Trust security model for supplier ecosystem risk
For supplier risk management, having customized solutions and greater visibility into who ultimately has access 
to an organization’s data across domains are top priorities. While there are many places to begin your Zero 
Trust journey, from a supplier ecosystem and risk management standpoint, instituting multifactor authentication 
(MFA) should be a priority. 
For more information on Zero Trust strategy, see the Hybrid workforce security  chapter of this report.How Microsoft     
thinks about    
supply chain
The end-to-end supply chain and supplier 
ecosystem is complex and opaque, extending 
from development to build, chips to firmware, 
drivers, operating system, third-party applications, 
manufacturing/factory, and all the way to secure 
updates. Governments and critical infrastructure 
providers are looking for a new level of assurance for 
supply chain security and continuity. It’s important 
that a repeatable process will continue to scale as 
organizations continue to innovate. Supply chain 
security rigor is foundational to how an organization 
should work and is expected by partners and 
customers who interact with an organization’s 
products and services.Nine secure supply chain focus 
areas
Outlined below is a framework to efficiently evaluate 
your supply chain ecosystem with considerations 
for how you might approach protecting it. We 
group our investments into nine secure supply chain 
workstreams to methodically evaluate and mitigate 
risk of exposure in each area.
1. First-party engineering systems for hardware 
and software 
Massive software development companies aren’t 
the only ones doing engineering work. Even small 
IT shops that may make minimal development 
investments and organizations building on top of 
existing infrastructure have teams writing code. 
Nine areas of investment for a secure end-to-end supply chain
                    74TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS
Introduction Managing supplier ecosystem risk How Microsoft thinks about supply chain IoT and OT threat landscape 7 properties of secured devices Applying Zero Trust to IoT IoT and sustainability IoT policy
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
To produce secure software or hardware, 
organizations must ensure that the first-party 
engineering system is secured from the various 
threat vectors that could be exploited by attackers.
Developer environment: The developer 
environment encompasses the tools and 
platforms that developers author code on, such 
as operating systems, code editors, research 
tools (for example, browsers and associated 
websites), local build tools, and other general 
code authoring tools. The primary target is 
developer identity, and solutions must be put 
in place to mitigate this risk.
Source code: The risk of malicious code can 
arise when developers take source code and 
binaries from a variety of sources, including 
from internal sources, open-source software 
(OSS), or from another organization. Each 
source needs to have a level of trust ensured 
and known to have appropriately secure 
supply chain checks. In most reported OSS-
as-malware cases, the malware is designed 
to steal developer credentials and build 
environment variables, exfiltrating them to a 
remote attacker-controlled server.Build:  Without appropriate protections, the 
build pipeline presents product compromise 
risks that can be highly effective and difficult 
to trace. While source control will usually have 
some form of change management, without 
appropriate controls in place in a build system, 
it can be difficult to identify what might have 
been injected during the build process.
Release:  Ensuring you are releasing what you 
intended is the end goal of a secure software 
supply chain. Enumerating inputs and verifying 
the final product takes a comprehensive 
understanding of complex systems and is an 
essential final step in ensuring an organization 
knows what it is releasing.
2. Firmware and driver security
Firmware and drivers are the foundation of most 
hardware devices. If hacked and embedded with 
malware, they pose a huge risk to the hardware 
device and the organization that depends on it, 
potentially creating unauthorized access, making it 
inoperable or even unbootable. Organizations need 
to ensure that all firmware and drivers installed on 
servers or end-user equipment follow the required 
security requirements and have the necessary 
documentation to prove their compliance.3. Physical security
Organizations must define, implement, and manage 
appropriate security controls to ensure the security
4. Manufacturing security
Manufacturing standards must be defined and 
enforced to enable detection, protection, and 
recovery from cyberattacks. Organizations must 
also ensure that samples or prototypes are 
securely handled and stored, and that appropriate 
monitoring is in place to track and maintain the 
chain of custody for all proprietary items or  
finished goods.
5. Logistics security
Logistics functions must be safeguarded to prevent 
tampering, loss, or theft of the products during 
transportation and storage. Hardware and devices 
teams should have appropriate operational controls 
and frameworks in place with the suppliers to ensure 
receiving, shipping, storage, and other logistics 
management nodes are secure and compliant with 
the company’s standards. 
6. Supplier security
When engaging with suppliers, organizations must 
ensure that the suppliers comply with well-defined 
supplier security and privacy assurance requirements 
throughout the duration of their partnership.LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING IN 
CONTINUOUS SECURITY MONITORING OF SUPPLIERS  
Microsoft leverages machine learning (ML) to scan 
active supplier contracts. This model is trained to 
recognize commonly negotiated security clauses 
and determine whether or not they meet the intent 
of the original requirement. The outputs of this 
continuous scanning are leveraged to advise the 
third parties operating within our environments and 
ensure their expectations and accountabilities are 
clearly defined.

Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
7. Security validations and assurances
The active nature of the adversaries requires 
continuous evaluation of the security posture of the 
end-to-end supply chain to identify and prioritize 
security investments. A mix of internal audits, 
lessons learned from recent events, and penetration 
testing provides assurance that the right controls  
are in place to detect, prevent, and/or mitigate  
these attacks. The findings from these engagements 
help identify the next set of requirements to  
be addressed.
8. Trust chain governance and resilience
Customers trust their supplier organizations protect 
them as they use their products and services. First-
party trust chains provide identity, integrity, and 
non-repudiation for the organization’s platform, 
products, and services. The main elements of trust 
chains are public key infrastructure, cryptographic 
algorithms, hardware, and the supporting teams and 
facilities. Effective governance of third-party trust 
chains is critical. 9. Monitoring and detections
Each of the supply chain focus areas above require 
monitoring, detection, and follow-up actions when 
questionable activity is identified. Increasingly 
monitoring, detection, and initial response are 
automated in today’s hyper-scaled cloud operations. 
These actions cover common cases but can also be 
adaptable to deal with new or unimagined scenarios.

Microsoft Security Development LifecycleUS Executive Order and 
supply chain security 
  
Issued on May 12, 2021, the Executive Order 
(EO) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity 
(EO 14028) outlines significant new steps for US 
federal agencies and their technology providers 
to strengthen IT modernization, improve incident 
response, and enhance software supply chain 
security.66 Section 4 focuses on software supply 
chain security, enumerating areas of requirements 
to be developed for both software providers and 
federal agency users of software. For software 
providers, the EO calls for requirements to enhance 
ability to resist tampering or attack and foster 
greater transparency into components, including 
through secure software development practices and 
environments, use of tools or processes for software 
verification and vulnerability checks, providing 
of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) information, 
participation in a vulnerability disclosure program, 
and other practices. For federal agency users of software with privileged access or other attributes 
that make it especially critical, the EO calls for 
security measures, published by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 
July, to manage operational risk. Microsoft has 
long invested in developing best practices for 
secure software development, software testing, 
and vulnerability disclosure and management 
programs, and we’ve contributed to efforts to define 
industrywide practices and consensus standards, 
including through SAFECode,68 ISO,69 and NIST.70 
Along with GitHub, Microsoft has also contributed to 
efforts to develop best practices and specifications 
to define use cases for and support the delivery of 
SBOMs, which identify what software is composed 
of and allow software providers to associate 
information with components. Microsoft and  
GitHub support delivering SBOMs to enable 
vulnerability and integrity checks, and we’re 
committed to leveraging SBOMs as part of a  
broader evidence store that would verify end-to-  
end supply chain integrity.

IoT and OT 
threat  
landscape
Successful solutions today often depend on the 
convergence of many components, including hardware, software, and cloud services, which often come together in an IoT solution. IoT is more than connected devices—it’s about the information those devices collect and the powerful, immediate insights that can be garnered from that information. Accordingly, IoT and other embedded and OTs have become critical business, operational, and security topics. More than ever, IoT and OT security is finding its way into corporate boardrooms and state and federal legislature discussions as a high-priority issue, in part due to the increasing frequency and severity of attacks in the past year. This proliferation of attacks has also driven increased awareness of the extent to which cyberattacks in the digital realm can impact the physical realm: the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack directly led to shutdown of the largest conduit for gasoline in the United States. The compromise of  the Oldsmar water plant
71 led to a hazardous situation, in which 
cyber actors obtained unauthorized access and used the SCADA system’s software to increase the concentration of sodium hydroxide—a caustic chemical—in the water. The hack of a security camera provider
72 exposed sensitive footage from 
hospitals, police departments, and a plethora of other companies.
All these developments underscore the need for 
organizations t
o secure their IoT and OT footprints. 
Organizations are interconnected more than ever, resulting in increased exposure of legacy OT devices and environments, including those that have existed in relative isolation. On the other hand, the newest IoT devices (such as smart TVs and smart sensors) reside in both OT and IT environments. Putting all of this together, with the added context of privacy concerns and regulatory compliance, stresses the need for a holistic approach that enables seamless security and governance across all OT and IoT devices.

Findings: Industrywide IoT and 
OT vulnerabilities 
The Microsoft Defender for IoT team conducts 
research on various types of equipment ranging 
from legacy industrial control system controllers 
to cutting-edge IoT sensors. Upon discovery of a 
vulnerability, the findings are shared with relevant 
vendors through a responsible disclosure process 
led by the Microsoft Security Response Center and 
the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
enabling these vendors to investigate and patch  
the vulnerability.
In April 2021, we uncovered a series of critical 
memory allocation vulnerabilities in IoT and OT 
devices that adversaries could exploit to bypass 
security controls to execute malicious code or cause 
a system crash. The group of vulnerabilities was 
dubbed BadAlloc. These remote code execution 
vulnerabilities affected a wide range of industries 
and verticals, from consumer and medical IoT, to 
industrial IoT, OT, and industrial control systems. 
They covered more than 25 common vulnerabilities 
and exposures (CVEs).  In the context of IT 
environments, an exploitation of such a vulnerability 
can result in a loss of confidentiality. In the context 
of OT environments, it can be used to trigger a 
disruption of operations.
The vulnerabilities stem from using vulnerable 
memory functions, such as malloc, calloc, realloc, memalign, valloc, pvalloc, and others. Our research 
showed that memory allocation implementations 
written throughout the years as part of IoT devices 
and embedded software have not incorporated 
proper input validations. Without these input 
validations, an attacker could exploit the memory 
allocation function to perform a heap overflow, 
resulting in execution of malicious code on a  
target device.
The memory allocation vulnerabilities can be 
invoked by calling the memory allocation function, 
such as malloc(VALUE), with the VALUE parameter 
derived dynamically from external input and being 
large enough to trigger an integer overflow or 
wraparound. The concept is as follows: When 
sending this value, the returned outcome is a 
freshly allocated memory buffer. While the size 
of the allocated memory remains small due to 
the wraparound, the payload associated with the 
memory allocation exceeds the actual allocated 
buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. This heap 
overflow enables an attacker to execute malicious 
code on the target device. 
 
BadAlloc is a case that illustrates the extensive 
impact these vulnerabilities can have because the 
risk exists in IoT and OT devices across all major 
industries. This example highlights one of the 
biggest challenges in mitigating IT, IoT, and OT risks: 
they share attack surfaces, and attackers look at the 
entire ecosystem. The following is an example of BadAlloc:
The protection of IoT and OT devices from 
exposure to IT risks becomes more important as 
they converge. Too often these risks are addressed 
in isolation with a rigidly siloed approach. To be 
successful in countering attacks, risks should be 
dealt with holistically while also accommodating 
domain expertise in each area. It is also critical to ensure that modern digital environments are 
not held back by threats from legacy technology 
connected to OT systems. Mitigation requires an 
integrated approach that spans the entire enterprise. 
Organizations should look for opportunities to 
harden, patch, or segment systems to reduce the 
attack surface.                            80TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

BadAlloc impact matrix
BadAlloc is an example of an IoT/OT family of vulnerabilities that poses a risk across all industries. The 
extent and nature of the risk depends on the specific context of usage of the device. BadAlloc shouldn’t 
be treated as only an OT or IT issue; instead, organizations should take a holistic approach to mitigating the risk.
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021Mitigating IoT and OT vulnerabilities such 
as BadAlloc 
We recommend the following mitigation strategies for organizations with IoT and OT devices:
Patch, patch, patch. Follow vendor instructions for 
applying patches to affected products.
If you can’t patch, monitor. Since most legacy 
IoT and OT devices don’t support agents, use an IoT/OT-aware network detection and response (NDR) solution
79 and a SIEM/SOAR solution80 to 
auto-discover and continuously monitor devices for anomalous or unauthorized behaviors, such as communication with unfamiliar local or remote hosts. These elements are essential in implementing a Zero Trust strategy for IoT/OT.
Reduce the attack surface. Eliminate unnecessary 
internet connections to OT control systems and implement virtual private network (VPN) access 
 
with MFA when remote access is required. The  
US DHS warns that VPN devices may also have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.Segment. Network segmentation is important for Zero Trust because it limits the attacker’s ability

The 7 properties  
of highly 
secured devices
We suggest ensuring the hardware and operating 
system of both your and your suppliers’ devices are designed and implemented securely, have high barriers to compromise, and incorporate mechanisms and processes that continually monitor, alert, and restore security when necessary.
Through extensive research and testing, Microsoft 
identified the seven properties that are present in all standalone, internet-connected devices considered to be highly secured. In many cases, these highly secured devices apply additional security measures, but in all cases each of the seven properties is present. Collectively, these seven properties provide a baseline foundation of security throughout device silicon, software architecture and OS, cloud communications, and cloud services. The complexity of maintaining all seven properties could be a barrier for some organizations, despite the exceptional cost that often results from a fallout of incomplete device security. 
Hardware root 
of trustDevice identity and integrity are protected by hardware. Physical countermeasures resist side-channel attacks. 
Does the device have a unique, unforgeable identity that is inseparable from the hardware? Is the integrity of the 
device software secured by hardware?
Defense in depthMultiple mitigations applied against threats. Countermeasures mitigate the consequences of a successful attack on any one vector. 
Does the device remain secured even if one security mechanism is breached?
Small trusted 
computing basePrivate keys stored in a hardware-protected vault, inaccessible to software. Division of software into self-protecting layers. Is the device’s security enforcement code protected from bugs in other software on the device?
Dynamic 
compartmentsHardware-enforced barriers between software components prevent a breach in one from propagating to others. Is a failure in one component of the device contained to that component? Can new compartments be added in 
field to address new security threats?
Password-less 
authenticationSigned token, signed by an unforgeable cryptographic key, proves the device identity and authenticity. 
Does the device authenticate itself with certificates or other tokens signed by the hardware root of trust?
Error reportingA software error, such as a buffer overrun induced by an attacker probing security, is reported to cloud-based failure 
analysis system. 
Does the device report errors for analysis to enable verification of the correctness of in-field device execution and identification of new threats?
Renewable 
securityUpdate brings the device forward to a secure state and revokes compromised assets for known vulnerabilities or security breaches.
 
Is the device’s software updated automatically? Can the device’s security TCB software be updated rapidly without repackaging other device code?                           82TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Applying a Zero 
T
rust approach 
to IoT solutions
Securing IoT solutions with a Zero Trust security 
model81 starts with non-IoT specific requirements—
specifically ensuring you have implemented the basics to securing identities and their devices and limiting their access. These requirements include explicitly verifying users, having visibility into the devices they’re bringing on to the network, and being able to make dynamic access decisions by using real-time risk detections. Meeting these requirements helps to limit the potential blast radius of users gaining unauthorized access to IoT services and data in the cloud or on-premises. Otherwise, you could face both mass information disclosure (such as leaked production data of a factory) and potential elevation of privilege for command and control of cyber-physical systems (such as stopping a factory production line).After basic security requirements are met, you can shif
t your focus to the specific Zero Trust 
requirements for IoT solutions:
Strong identity to authenticate devices
Register devices, issue renewable credentials, employ passwordless authentication, and use a hardware root of trust to ensure you can trust its identity before making decisions.
Least privilege access to mitigate blast radius
Implement device and workload access control to limit any pot
ential blast radius from authenticated 
identities that may have been compromised or running unapproved workloads.
Device health to gate access or flag devices  
for r
emediation
Check security configuration, assess for vulnerabilities and insecur
e passwords, and monitor 
for active threats and anomalous behavioral alerts  to build ongoing risk profiles.Continual updates to keep devices healthyUtilize a centralized configuration and compliance management solution and a r
obust update 
mechanism to ensure devices are up to date and in  a healthy state.
Security monitoring and response to detect and 
r
espond to emerging threats
Employ proactive monitoring to rapidly identify unauthorized or compr
omised devices.

IOT at the 
intersection of 
cybersecurity 
and  
sustainability
Organizations generally deploy IoT to improve the 
bottom line: better quality, higher productivity/
less downtime, production optimization, and 
reducing operating costs and/or increasing output 
nonlinearly. Improving the business in these ways 
also reduces waste: less resource use for the same 
or greater output, higher uptime, reduction in scrap, 
and so on. While IoT investment specifically for 
sustainability is less common, sustainability as an 
initiative is no longer regarded as a zero-sum effort 
in conflict with business value.
As organizations face increasing pressure to improve 
their environmental footprint—from shareholder 
calls and new government regulations—sustainability will become a primary driver for 
operational deployment of IoT. To make significant 
improvements to their environmental footprint, 
organizations must assess and monitor their 
behavior and then use automated or remote-
control methods to optimize it.
The challenge is figuring out how to measure, 
monitor, and automate these systems securely. 
These systems might contain sensitive data, connect 
to business systems across your organization, 
and increasingly impact the physical operation of 
your enterprise. Attacks like the aforementioned 
Triton82 or Crash Override83 that specifically target 
OT systems demonstrate that these systems 
are attractive targets for nation states and 
cybercriminals, and they have the potential to both 
disrupt business operations and potentially create 
environmental damage.
It is essential to assess the security of OT systems 
with the same rigor and comprehensiveness as 
IT systems. As we have observed, attackers will 
choose the “soft targets” as a point of ingress.  Spear 
phishing or similar attacks allow access to IT systems that can then provide a pathway for attackers to 
reach OT systems, and the reverse is also possible. 
In one example, attackers used an aquarium 
system to access a casino’s high-roller databases,84
demonstrating that any device with connectivity can 
present a motivated attacker with an opening.
While many organizations are evolving their IT 
security approach (moving away from a perimeter-
based security model to a Zero Trust model), IoT 
is often overlooked and lagging. For example, 
organizations know to encrypt sensitive data from 
applications, but many have not considered that 
their control systems rely on the Modbus protocol, 
which by design lacks any authentication and sends 
data in the open. While PCs are routinely required 
to have updated certificates, IoT devices are often 
deployed with factory default passwords.
Compromises in these OT systems may disrupt 
operations, but attackers are also focusing on how 
IoT and OT interact. Industrial control systems are 
often updated or retrofitted with remote capabilities, 
introducing new attack vectors that allow virtual 
attacks to cause harm in physical scenarios. Earlier 
this year, a water treatment plant in Florida fell 
victim to an attacker that remotely accessed critical 
systems and attempted to alter the amount of 
chemicals in the water supply.85Moreover, it is critical to understand the security 
posture of supply systems that are not on the 
organization’s IT/OT network, but nonetheless affect 
operations. Just as an organization looks to improve 
efficiency and sustainability, its suppliers do too. 
These supply systems may be connected outside 
of the network (such as cellular) to measure and 
monitor the device operation, reduce truck rolls, 
and deliver more uptime. Compromises in externally 
managed infrastructure components can directly 
impact downstream businesses. For example, turning 
off the chillers in a building could halt operations 
and spoil inventory, air quality sensors may not alert 
workers to unsafe conditions, and so on.
While IoT can and will enable better environmental 
practices, it is essential that all connected systems—
which may be in place for a decade or longer—are 
designed, evaluated, and operated securely. As the 
world adapts to the new priorities that emerged 
during the pandemic, companies are looking to 
address the growing sustainability challenges ahead. 
Secured IoT will play a critical role in enabling 
businesses to both sustainably use and protect vital 
resources and utilities today and into the future.
It is essential to assess the security of OT systems with 
the same rigor and comprehensiveness as IT systems.

IoT security 
policy  
considerations
Policymakers around the world are acknowledging 
the profound implications of IoT security for privacy, 
safety, critical infrastructure protection, and digital 
transformation in general. Approaches to IoT 
security policy range from voluntary programs to 
mandatory security requirements. The range of IoT 
device types, growing number of devices, and the 
volume of interactions between devices, the physical 
world, and the internet make developing effective and appropriately tailored cybersecurity policy a 
complex task. To tackle the IoT threat landscape, 
the global community of IoT manufacturers and 
cybersecurity experts has developed sets of 
best practice standards for IoT device cybersecurity. 
These standards have demonstrated effectiveness 
against common attacks, and industry and 
policymakers alike can leverage them for  
immediate improvements to the global state of 
IoT device security for consumer, enterprise, and 
government users.
Minimum security baselines
Standards for minimum IoT security baselines 
provide a promising start to improving global cybersecurity health. These standards are intended 
to provide guidance for manufacturers, developers, 
and users to identify and adopt best practices for 
device security. Prominent examples of international 
standards include the European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI) standard for consumer 
IoT security released in June 2020, ETSI EN 303 645 . 
The ETSI standard is now a public set of resources 
that governments and companies around the world 
can use to enhance the security of IoT devices, 
and it includes both governance and technical 
recommendations. It was created through a  
rigorous and collaborative multistakeholder process 
involving experts from industry, government, 
and academia. Similarly, after an iterative public 
consultation process, in May 2020, NIST released 
NISTIR 8259A, which details a baseline set of device 
capabilities necessary for common cybersecurity 
controls. The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) and the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) are also 
developing a minimum-security baseline. 
Policy can help manufacturers adopt international 
standards in a consistent way to improve security 
across a range of consumer products and 
promote an advanced state of security in critical 
applications. In the United States, policy initiatives 
based on standards include the IoT Cybersecurity 
Improvement Act of 2020,87 which references NISTIR 
8259A for managing risks associated with US federal agency use of IoT devices, and EO 14028, which 
proposes a consumer IoT device labeling program 
that may also reference NISTIR 8259A as well as 
compatibility with ETSI or ISO standards. Other 
examples include the proposed mandatory security 
requirements for consumer smart devices in the 
UK,88 and the voluntary device labeling schemes 
in Singapore and Finland, all based on ETSI EN 
303 645. In leveraging international standards and 
widely used best practices, policymakers can also 
help to ensure that mandatory requirements are 
consistent and mutually recognized across regions 
to avoid fragmentation that would work against IoT 
innovation, interoperability, and security.
Global Cyber Alliance project: 
How policy and standards improve IoT security 
Standards, laws, and proposed requirements for 
minimum IoT device security baselines share many 
commonly recommended or required controls. 
The first three provisions of the ETSI standard for 
consumer IoT security, ETSI EN 303 645, are the most 
highly recommended by ETSI and make appearances 
in several national-level policies. These include:
1. No default passwords 
2. Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy
3. Keep software updated

State laws in California and Oregon both prohibit 
default passwords for IoT devices. Similarly, 
recommendations or requirements for updated 
software and use of secure communications 
protocols like HTTPS also frequently appear in 
standards and policies around the globe.
Microsoft supported a research study conducted by  
the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA)89 to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of commonly recommended 
controls in preventing attacks. The analysis can be used to help policymakers and industry leaders 
understand the benefit of best practice approaches 
to IoT device security, and as proof points for 
manufacturers to adopt standards and comply  
with policy. 
Using home-grown honeypot technology, GCA 
created an enticingly accessible target for would-be 
attackers to learn as much as possible about the 
existence, source, and prevalence of attacks. GCA 
operated a large honey farm of several hundred emulated IoT devices distributed worldwide to 
provide real, at-scale, long-term attack data to 
understand trends and changes in IoT attack 
methodologies. 
The research tested three controls commonly 
referenced in IoT security standards and policy: 
• Secured access control (“no default passwords”)
• Device capability to update software and 
recommendation to keep software updated
• Data in transit is protectedSUMMARY OF GCA CONCLUSIONS
GCA’s analysis of real attack data shows that default 
passwords factory-set by device manufacturers and 
never changed by users, along with weak passwords 
set by users, together represent the most exploited 
security vulnerability for IoT devices. Policy and 
regulatory frameworks can help drive adoption and 
harmonize implementation of the requirements in 
IoT device security standards such as NISTIR 8259, 
ETSI EN 303 645, and ISO/IEC 27402 to promote 
secured access control best practices and address 
this risk.

The research also showed widespread prevalence 
of attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities in 
the software stacks of IoT devices. This finding 
offers support for the effectiveness of keeping 
software updated and using secure communications 
protocols to prevent attempts to compromise 
security vulnerabilities.
The prevalence of attack attempts observed on 
security vulnerabilities in IoT device software also 
supports the notion that commonly recommended 
nontechnical controls would reduce the likelihood 
of attack success. In particular, requirements for 
manufacturers to implement a vulnerability disclosure 
and management policy and to disclose the security 
support status of their products would provide 
valuable information to consumers.

signals support these findings
The GCA project findings align well to what Microsoft 
sees across its IoT sensor network. Generic HTTP 
scanning and scraping forms the bulk of requests we 
receive, followed by Secure Shell (SSH) and Telnet, 
respectively. Both protocols are frequently seen 
across IoT/OT devices, with Telnet in particular being 
a favorite of botnets like MIRAI and others based on 
it. The two protocols are also commonly associated 
with brute force password attacks, and when taken 
together become the most prevalent type of attack 
we see against IoT/OT devices. 
Distribution of attacks against popular IoT/OT 
protocols (July 2020-June 2021)
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021When we look at attacks against these two ports, we see things are anything but static. Different actors come 
and go, in many cases repurposing bots with leaked source code such as MIRAI. Often these attacks replicate 
existing ways of working, but we have started to see more advanced use cases where bots are leveraging new 
exploits.90 It is worth noting that many of these attacks continue to use poor passwords as a basis for lateral 
movement between infected hosts.
Microsoft’s sensor network gives us raw data on these types of attacks and the passwords in use. We looked at 
over 280,000 attacks and analyzed the password data we collected. Perhaps unsurprisingly we saw that 96% of 
attacks used a password with fewer than 10 characters, 92% had fewer than 8, and slightly more shockingly, 72% 
of all attacks required only trying a password of 6 characters or less. Within these password attempts, only 2% 
included a special character and 72% didn’t even contain a number.
The attacks we are seeing in the wild line up with the GCA data and other reports. Default passwords, which are 
generally a single short English word, make it trivial for an attacker to access an organization’s infrastructure. If 
secure identity management with an organization’s IoT devices is not an option, longer passwords—especially 
those with special characters—are strongly advised.

INTRODUCTION:  The basics matter
BRET ARSENAULT, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER
This past year continued to challenge us in profound ways. While most industries made the shift to remote 
work due to the pandemic, it created new attack surfaces for cybercriminals to take advantage of, such as 
home devices being used for business purposes. In the first half of 2021, there were three significant assaults: 
NOBELIUM (the SolarWinds supply chain attack), HAFNIUM (an on-premises Exchange server attack), and 
Colonial Pipeline (a ransomware attack). 
Many lessons can be learned. First, a continuing 
threat vector is email compromise. In fact, phishing is 
responsible for almost 70% of data breaches.91 Second, 
cybercriminals are using malware that is posed as a 
legitimate software update to target unsuspecting 
employees. Third, ransomware attackers have raised 
the stakes to focus not only on double or triple 
extortion tactics in terms of a payout but are also 
offering ransomware as a service (RaaS), which uses 
a partner network to carry out an attack, making it 
tough to determine who the real bad actor is. Finally, 
adversaries are targeting on-premises systems, 
reinforcing the need for organizations to move 
infrastructure to the cloud where security is more 
difficult to penetrate.92 
While these incidents taught us tough lessons, a key 
takeaway is that the basics matter . A primary way 
criminals get in is through an unlocked door. If compromised organizations had applied basic 
security hygiene like patching, applying updates, or 
turning on multifactor authentication (MFA), they 
may have been spared or less impacted. In fact, it 
is shocking that less than 20% of our customers are 
using strong authentication such as MFA93 (which 
is free to our customers and can be turned on by 
default). Organizations that do not apply or maintain 
these basic hygiene practices will face much greater 
exposure to attacks. 
Along with the security basics, Microsoft relies on 
an approach called Zero Trust,94 which assumes the 
network has been breached. Zero Trust means we 
don’t assume any identity or device on our network 
is secure—we continually verify it. Zero Trust helps 
us strike a balance in making sure employees can be 
productive, secure, and healthy beyond the corporate 
network from home, the office, or anywhere in-between.Recommendations for getting 
started with Zero Trust:
• Identities are validated and secured with MFA 
everywhere.  Using MFA helps eliminate the need 
for passwor ds. The added use of biometrics (such 
as retina eye scans or fingerprints) also ensures 
strong authentication of a user’s identity.
• Devices are managed and validated as healthy. 
As a condition of access t o any company resource, 
all device types and operating systems should be 
required to meet a minimum healthy device state 
before being validated. 
• Monitoring and threat signals are pervasive. 
Make sure to collect all av ailable logs, data, and 
signals to understand the current security state, 
which will help you identify gaps in coverage, 
discover anomalies, and drive a better employee 
experience.

Moving toward a hybrid 
workforce at Microsoft 
No one knows how or when the COVID-19 
pandemic will end, but at some point, COVID-19 will no longer place a significant burden on our communities and will present itself more like an endemic virus such as influenza. Local health situations and local government guidance determines how many employees we allow at a worksite and what services are made available. Once a location fully reopens, we return to somewhat normal operations with services that were provided pre-pandemic. As Microsoft offices globally invite more employees back to the worksite, we are gradually seeing an increase in the number of employees badging-in (scanning their badges for building entry) each week. We expect this number will continue to rise as more locations fully reopen. However, we do not expect these numbers to reach pre-pandemic levels of attendance. Our flexible work approach means that we expect to see most employees spending at least some time each week working remotely, even in locations where COVID-19 is no longer a significant burden.

A Zero Trust 
approach for 
securing hybrid  
work
The increasing prevalence of cloud-based services, 
mobile computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and 
“bring your own device” (BYOD) in hybrid work 
environments has changed the technology 
landscape for today’s enterprise. Security 
architectures that rely on network firewalls and 
virtual private networks (VPNs) to isolate and 
restrict access to corporate technology resources 
and services are no longer sufficient for a workforce 
that regularly requires access to applications and 
resources that exist beyond traditional corporate 
network boundaries.  The shift to the internet 
as the network of choice and the continuously 
evolving threats led Microsoft to adopt a Zero Trust 
security model. Zero Trust has become a priority of 
enterprise security leaders around the world.
We are facing a moment of reckoning as the world 
witnesses a rise in increasingly sophisticated and 
expansive cybersecurity attacks. This reality—
coupled with work entering its next great disruption, 
the move to hybrid environments—has ushered in an urgent opportunity for all companies around 
the world to adopt a Zero Trust approach and 
assume all activity, even by trusted users, could be 
an attempted breach. Signals across the industry 
highlight that every company needs to create a 
culture of security and modernize their approach to 
ensure they are protected.
Zero Trust principles
Zero Trust eliminates the inherent trust that is 
assumed inside the traditional corporate network. 
An effective Zero Trust architecture is designed to 
reduce risk at every opportunity across the digital 
estate. In practice, this means that every transaction 
between systems must be validated and proven 
trustworthy before the transaction can occur. For an 
effective Zero Trust strategy, we recommend these 
guiding principles:

An integrated security 
philosophy and end-to-end strategy 
Zero Trust controls and technologies are deployed 
across six foundational technology pillars. Each 
pillar is a source of signal, a control plane for 
enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended. 
In a Zero Trust architecture, they are interconnected 
by automated enforcement of security policy, 
correlation of signal and security automation, and 
orchestration.1. Identities
Identities can represent people, services, or IoT 
devices. When an identity attempts to access 
a resource, verify that identity with strong 
authentication, and ensure access is compliant and 
typical for that identity. Follow least privilege access 
principles.
2. Endpoints
Once an identity has been granted access to a 
resource, data can flow to a variety of different 
endpoints—from IoT devices to smartphones, BYOD 
to partner-managed devices, and on-premises 
workloads to cloud-hosted servers. This diversity 
creates a massive attack surface area. Monitor and 
enforce device health and compliance for secure 
access.

3. Applications
Applications and application programming 
interfaces (APIs) provide the interface by which data 
is consumed. They may be legacy on-premises, 
workloads moved to the cloud, or modern software 
as a service (SaaS) applications. Apply controls and 
technologies to discover shadow or unsanctioned IT, 
ensure appropriate in-app permissions, gate access 
based on real-time analytics, monitor for abnormal 
behavior, control user actions, and validate secure 
configuration options.
4. Network 
All data is ultimately accessed over network 
infrastructure. Networking controls can provide 
critical controls to enhance visibility and help 
prevent attackers from moving laterally across 
the network. Segment networks (and do deeper 
in-network micro-segmentation) and deploy real-
time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, 
monitoring, and analytics.5. Infrastructure
Infrastructure—whether on-premises servers, cloud-
based virtual machines (VMs), containers, or micro-
services—represents a critical threat vector. Assess 
for version, configuration, and JIT access to harden 
defense. Use logging and monitoring to detect 
attacks and anomalies, and automatically block and 
flag risky behavior and take protective actions.
6. Data
Ultimately, security teams are protecting data. Data 
should remain protected throughout its lifecycle 
even if it leaves the devices, apps, infrastructure, 
and networks the organization controls. Use data 
classification and labeling as context to encrypt, 
minimize access to, control the flow of, and mask or 
delete sensitive information at the end of its useful 
or legally mandated life.

 (6/30/2021)Zero Trust adoption
The Zero Trust Adoption Report95 illuminates the 
path of Zero Trust adoption across diverse markets 
and industries. We hope that the learning gained 
by this research can help accelerate your own Zero 
Trust strategy adoption, shed light on the collective 
progress of your peers, and provide insights on the 
future state of this rapidly evolving space.
No single security risk area stands out as a primary 
starting point for Zero Trust strategy, as fewer than 
15% start with the same security risk area. 
Organizations are beginning in different places, 
likely based on their needs and available internal 
resources. Most organizations approach Zero Trust 
as an end-to-end strategy to be completed over 
time. Eventually, they seek to adopt this strategy 
across all security risk areas to ensure even more 
protection against threats. 
 Hybrid workplace intent
The shift to a hybrid workplace is driving 
broader adoption of Zero Trust strategy. 81% of 
enterprise organizations have begun the move 
toward a hybrid workplace, with 31% already 
fully adopted.

Zero Trust Security Model and Framework Microsoft Security | Identities
In Azure Active Directory we observe 50 million 
password attacks daily, yet only 20% of users 
and 30% of global admins are using strong 
authentications such as MFA.96 Password-based 
attacks remain the main source of Identity 
compromise. However, other types of attacks are 
emerging, including consent phishing and attacks 
on nonhuman identities.
Password-based attacks 
Azure AD is the front door to all Microsoft cloud 
services. Our sign-in service sees 90 billion 
authentication requests per day, which gives us 
great visibility on identity attacks happening 
across all our clouds. Password-based attacks on 
user identities are still the most prevalent vector 
of identity compromise. While password spray 
and credential stuffing used to be the largest 
vectors of identity compromise, in the last year, 
we observed a significant change of tactics by the 
bad-actor ecosystem. In the last few years, but most 
notably during the pandemic, Microsoft and our 
customers have invested significantly in reducing 
the attack surface for bad actors to compromise 
Azure AD–backed accounts. The enhancement of 
security posture (security defaults, MFA adoption, 
password protection, legacy authentication block), as well as our investments in detection (malicious 
IP address, password spray detection), have caused 
a reduction in password brute-force attacks that 
use legacy authentication protocols, such as IMAP 
or SMTP . The volume of attacks that we attribute to 
breach replay and password spray have decreased 
significantly, while at the same time we are seeing 
a large increase in attacks attributed to phishing 
or other more sophisticated techniques, such as 
credential harvesting with malware. The data shows 
that bad actors have adapted their tactics to keep 
compromising accounts.
 
Although blocking legacy authentication and 
enabling MFA are still the most important defenses 
for any organization, phishing protection is 
becoming more relevant than ever. Even with 
MFA enabled, users can still have their credentials 
phished by real-time man-in-the-middle phishing 
tools that replicate the sign-in page and replay 
the MFA prompt to collect the one-time password 
sent to the user. To protect from this type of attack, 
customers can adopt Fido2-based credentials (based 
on a public key cryptographic key pair), such as 
security keys or Windows Hello for Business.97
Identity is more important than ever.

 Rise in phishing emails using OAuth request URLs
Geo-distribution of IP addresses issuing 
password brute-force attacks in July 2021
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021Emerging trends in attacks
OAuth consent phishing
In typical phishing, an attacker looking to steal 
credentials will craft a convincing email, host a 
fake landing page, and expect the user to fall for 
the lure. On a successful phishing attempt, the 
user credentials are passed on to the attacker. 
Consent phishing is a bit different. This method 
attempts to trick users into granting permissions 
to a malicious attacker-owned application and uses 
the obtained access tokens to retrieve the users’ 
account data. This is a very sophisticated attack as the access tokens do not require knowledge of a 
user’s password, and the user’s password is never 
shared with the attacker. Most importantly, as this is 
not a credential based attack, strong authentication 
requirements such as MFA do not prevent attacks 
that use this technique.
In the last six months, the monthly average of 
phishing emails using OAuth URLs has almost 
doubled. These phishing emails target a variety of 
legitimate cloud services such as Microsoft, Google, 
and Facebook. We are seeing an upward trend in the 
number of unique emails with OAuth phishing links.
 Microsoft recommends limiting user consent to 
allow user consent only to apps from verified 
publishers.
Microsoft has deployed several defenses to counter 
this trend, including specific machine-learning-
based detections to identify, isolate, and disable 
malicious applications. Strategies that can help 
prevent such attacks include granular user consent 
policies, blocking consent-phishing emails, anomaly 
detection, and user awareness training.                                95TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

As a result of these countermeasures, there was 
an 89% increase in disabled apps from January to 
June 2021 compared to July to December 2020. 
Upon detailed investigation, we saw that the major 
malicious vectors have shifted from a multi-tenant 
phishing attack to an abusive type of attack.

 (7/14/2021)Attacks on nonhuman accounts 
We saw a significant uptick in the volume of 
attacks against applications and service principal 
identities.98 Unlike users, these identities are often 
more vulnerable because organizations do not 
consistently apply many of the typical safeguards 
such as strong authentication, rigorous lifecycle 
management, and security monitoring to this 
category of accounts. As a result, we have seen 
attackers exploiting application identities that 
already have a privileged role or are scoped to a 
wide set of permissions. Unlike the typical “Initial 
Access -> Privilege Escalation” attack chain, 
this attack vector gains initial access through a 
compromised user or a leaked application credential.
We have seen attackers who gain initial access 
through a compromised user use their elevated 
privilege to conduct reconnaissance to identify 
applications with existing permissions, add a new set 
of application credentials if needed, and even assign 
privileged roles to the application. As a result, the 
application behaves normally in the environment 
while still operating as a tool for the attacker. 
Customers should conduct a review of application 
roles and permissions to conform to the principle 
of least privilege and monitor their Azure AD Audit 
logs for unfamiliar activity on applications and 
service principals.The challenge of credentials in code is not a new 
one. While most major vendors including Azure 
DevOps and GitHub offer safeguards to flag such 
credentials for removal, the practice persists. Those 
credentials provide attackers a direct path into 
an organization’s environment while flying under 
the radar in the Azure AD Audit logs. Microsoft 
recommends that customers audit their engineering 
artifacts, including code repositories for credentials.
Adoption of security posture
Strong authentication adoption
For identities, verifying explicitly means ensuring 
the identities are using strong authentication when 
accessing resources. Microsoft research shows that 
requiring strong authentication can protect against 
99.9% of the identity attacks because the majority 
of the attacks are related to passwords. While 
augmenting passwords can help defend against 
those attacks, eliminating passwords altogether 
with passwordless authentication methods can 
provide the most usable and secure authentication 
experience.
As companies have been adapting their security 
posture for remote work and a hybrid workforce, 
we have seen over 220% increase in strong 
authentication usage in the last 18 months. 
Hackers don’t break in, 
they log in.

Growth in Zero Trust access policy usage
Azure AD Conditional Access is a security policy engine for verifying explicitly and granting least privilege 
access. In the last year, the number of conditional access policies deployed has more than doubled, as 
organizations revamped their security postures to account for a remote workforce.
When a user accesses an application, administrators can use conditional access to configure which additional 
requirements are enforced to grant access. As organizations embrace Zero Trust security principles, we have 
seen greater adoption in managed device and managed app requirements in addition to MFA.

Legacy protocols: A preferred entry point for adversaries
One of the leading sources of compromise in organizations is authentication from legacy protocols, such 
as IMAP , SMTP , POP , and MAPI. These protocols do not support MFA, so they are preferred entry points for 
adversaries. In fact, 99% of password spray and 97% of credential stuffing attacks use legacy authentication, 
according to authentication data from Azure AD. Data from Azure AD reveals that the compromise rate for 
authentications using IMAP clients is 22 times higher than the compromise rate for authentications from  
a browser. 
Account compromise rate by authentication protocol (July 2020 – June 2021)
Fortunately, end users and admins have begun making progress toward using modern authentication in  
their organizations.
The hybrid world is largely “perimeterless,” so wrapping protections around identity and devices is critical. As 
part of Zero Trust, we also think the future is passwordless,100 and we will start to see that transition this year.
Percentage of legacy authentication among monthly active users of Azure Active Directory
Over the past year, we have seen the percent of users with legacy authentication clients decrease over 
30% to nearly 10% of users in Azure AD.

Devices/Endpoints 
What we’re seeing  
Mostly driven by necessity as the world shifted to a remote or hybrid work model, users are working from 
anywhere, from any device, more than any time in history, and attackers are quickly adjusting their tactics to 
take advantage of this change. Enterprises are left weighing the benefits of enabling BYOD (allowing their end 
users to access corporate resources that traditionally required VPN or on-premises access) against the increased 
risk of the same users unintentionally installing ransomware or other malware while performing non-work-
related functions on their personal devices. By enabling BYOD using a Zero Trust model, enterprises can reduce 
provisioning costs and avoid additional hardware purchases for work-from-home use, but they need to be able 
to protect their corporate assets on these devices, while still allowing the users to perform non-work functions 
on these same devices.
Mobile device management (Intune data)
Sharp rise in mobile device management growth as workers moved from office to BYOD and home PCsRecommendations for mitigating BYOD risk
To mitigate the increased risks of any BYOD model, it’s important to ensure constant verification of specified 
security standards as well as validation of the identity of the device and user to gate control of critical company 
resources. For example, you can block access to a personal device that has been jailbroken (modified to remove 
restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operator) to ensure that enterprise applications are not exposed to 
known vulnerabilities.

Applications 
Moving from legacy to Zero 
Trust–ready applications
As we move from a security model centered on 
the corporate network to one based on identities, 
thousands of apps and services with internally facing 
posture remain heavily reliant on network firewalls 
and VPNs to isolate and restrict access. They were 
built around legacy authentication mechanisms, 
keeping them grounded within corporate networks. 
These traditional architectures built for legacy apps 
were designed for lateral connectivity rather than 
micro segmentation. They violate the fundamental 
principle of least privilege access and are more 
vulnerable to lateral movement across the network 
by an adversary, which in turn could expose confidential data. For more on recent attack trends 
in this area, please see the Legacy protocols  and 
OAuth consent phishing  sections of this report.
Using modern apps and data solutions
In a cloud-centric architecture, we treat our 
applications and data differently. With more user-
design models becoming available, engineers 
no longer function as the only developers in 
an organization. Users are taking advantage of 
platforms and tools that offer no-code or low-code 
development methods to create business solutions.     
Organizations should invest in creating the right 
guardrails for these new paradigms. Tracking 
cloud resources and applying correct policies and 
templates help to ensure that modern solutions 
immediately use the correct controls.

Network 
A Zero Trust approach encourages organizations 
to assume they are always under attack and 
that a security incident can happen at any time. 
To be prepared with a setup that minimizes the 
blast radius of such an incident, networks should 
be segmented when the layout is designed. 
Implementing these software-defined perimeters 
with increasingly granular controls will increase 
the “cost” to attackers to propagate through the 
network and thereby dramatically reduce the lateral 
movement of threats.
What we’re seeing in Azure 
Firewall signals 
As migration to cloud accelerates, we are seeing that 
most new deployments are hybrid with connectivity 
back to on-premises and configured for internet 
breakout (micro perimeter) from Azure. All data is 
ultimately accessed over network infrastructure. Customers are using network segmentation for 
organizing workloads and deploying firewalls for 
securing traffic across subnets, VNETs, to on-
premises, and to the internet. Customers are using 
firewalls to control and enhance visibility into all the 
network flows.
Web application firewall 
Web application firewalls (WAFs) have evolved from 
an initial focus on injection-type attacks, such as 
SQL injection and cross-site scripting, to include 
attacks from malicious bots and API abuses. When 
combined with distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
protection, WAF forms an integral part of defense-
in-depth strategy for protecting web and API assets.
WAF over the past year has upwards of 25 billion 
rules triggered on a per-week basis. Approximately 
4% to 5% of incoming traffic on average is deemed 
malicious and is blocked either at the network edge 
or at the regional data center depending on where 
WAF is configured.
Most common network attack types   
Azure Firewall blocks millions of attempted 
exploits daily. Our signals show that attackers 
most commonly used malware, phishing, web 
applications, and mobile malware in their attempts 
at network attacks during July 2021. Also in 
July, there was a significant uptick in the use of 
coinminers, a type of malware that uses the network 
to mine cryptocurrency. 
The protocols leveraged most often in attacks were 
HTTP , TCP , and DNS, as they are open to the internet.

DDoS attacks 
In our 2020 DDoS retrospective,101 we highlighted 
shifts in the very active cyberthreat landscape. With 
the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in internet 
traffic, DDoS attacks on internet-facing endpoints 
ramped up significantly. We continue to see similar 
trends in the first half of 2021 as well. The trend is 
characterized by large TCP attacks, mainly SYN, SYN 
ACK, and ACK floods and user datagram protocol 
(UDP) reflection attacks. Online gaming and the 
gaming vertical continues to be a very attractive 
target of DDoS attacks. The majority of attacks on 
the gaming vertical have been mutations of MIRAI 
botnets and low-volume UDP protocol attacks. There is also an uptick in DDoS attacks against IPv6 
this year. This is an indication that as more IPv6 is 
adopted in the enterprise networks, the risk of DDoS 
attacks on IPv6 will continue to increase.
Daily attacks and volume
Compared to the latter part of 2020, the average 
daily number of attack mitigations in the first half 
of 2021 increased by 25% while the average attack 
bandwidth per-public IP increased by 30%. Azure 
DDoS Protection mitigated 1,200 to 1,400 unique 
DDoS attacks every day in the first half of 2021. As 
of July 2021, the average attack size in 2021 (325 
Gbps) was 25% larger than in 2020 (250 Gbps). 
DDoS attack mitigations
Number of unique DDoS attacks mitigated daily by MicrosoftAttack duration
Microsoft’s DDoS Protection team continues to see 
that most attacks are of short duration, with 75.35% 
being 30 minutes or less and 87.60% being one hour 
or less. This trend is similar to what we observed  
in 2020.

More than 35% of the attack volume targeted 
HTTPS and 10% targeted HTTP . UDP attacks 
represented 43% of the overall attack vectors, with 
amplification attacks accounting for 11% of attacks. 
Besides DNS and NTP reflection attacks, there has 
been a surge in remote desktop protocol (RDP) and 
datagram transport layer security (DTLS) reflection 
attacks.

The average packet size of TCP flood has been 
much smaller compared to UDP attack packets. UDP 
Fragment attacks averaged 1145 bytes per packet while TCP invalid syn averaged 512 bytes. TCP attack vectors such as SYN ACK, TCP Zero Seq, FIN-ACK and RST Floods averaged below 100 bytes per packet.
Europe, Asia, and the United States remain the most 
attacked regions because of the concentration of financial services and gaming industries in these regions. The UAE has been increasingly hit by DDoS attacks on government, oil and gas, telecom, and healthcare industries/sectors.
Top source regions from where the DDoS attacks 
originated were from Russia, Romania, Turkey, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, owing to the prevalence of DDoS attack-for-hire services in those regions.Learn more:

Cybercriminal DDoS services 
Between November 2020 and May 2021, the 
average price of a DDoS attack increased over 500%. The reasons for the price increase are multifaceted:
The rising cost of goods sold for DDoS services has made them more expensive and resulted in a decrease in supply relative to demand.
• The price for loads that are turned into DDoS bots increased as demand for loads for all monetization strategies increased beyond supply. (Loads are freshly infected devices which are sold to third parties, who install their malware on the device.) Attackers have found more effective strategies to monetize loads that are delivering more value than they would get using them for DDoS attacks. These include buying loads to conduct ransomware, spyware, adware, and banking theft monetization strategies. 
• Some antivirus products use outbound DDoS attacks to detect malware. Therefore, the lifecycle of the bots used in DDoS attacks is shorter than it used to be, requiring the DDoS service to continuously buy new loads to maintain their capabilities. 
• Improved DDoS mitigation strategies make it more complex to perform quality attacks.
It has become more common for actors that want to conduct DDoS attacks to rely on these DDoS services to conduct them. As a result, many attackers no longer have the skills or infrastructure to conduct their own DDoS attacks. In other words, costs are rising due to lack of alternatives.Starting in late June, the advertised cost of DDoS services decreased back toward the equilibrium that was observed until November 2020. This shift was likely caused by two factors. First, there was a recent increase in the supply of fresh loads available for purchase from the DDoS services. Second, there was a decrease in ads for premium DDoS services. The margins for DDoS services were being squeezed by increased costs and lack of demand for high-priced DDoS services, leading some of the premium DDoS services to move from a “publicly available service” in the cybercriminal forums to more private services that don’t advertise.Learn more:

Infrastructure 
Infrastructure represents a critical threat vector. 
IT and applications infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or multi-cloud, is defined as all the hardware (physical, virtual, containerized), software (open source, first- and third-party, platform as a service (PaaS), SaaS, functions, and APIs), micro-services, networking infrastructure, and facilities that are required to develop, test, deliver, monitor, control, or support IT services and applications. It is an area where Microsoft has invested tremendous resources to develop a comprehensive set of capabilities to secure future cloud and on-premises infrastructure.
Collaboration with MITRE on 
an ATT&CK-style matrix
The flexibility and scalability of containers encourage 
many developers to move their workloads to Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications. While Kubernetes has many advantages, it also brings new security challenges that should be considered. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the various security risks that exist in containerized environments, and specifically in Kubernetes.
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base of known tactics and techniques that are involved in cyberattacks. Started with coverage for Windows and Linux, the matrices of MITRE ATT&CK cover the various stages that are involved in cyberattacks (tactics) and elaborate the known methods in each one of them (techniques). Those matrices help organizations understand the attack surface in their environments and make sure they have adequate detections and mitigations to the various risks.
When the Azure Security Center team began mapping the security landscape of Kubernetes, they noticed that although the attack techniques are different than those targeting Linux or Windows, the tactics are similar. For example, a translation from OS to container clusters would be “initial access to the computer,” which becomes “initial access to the cluster.” So, the team created the first Kubernetes attack matrix: an ATT&CK-like matrix comprising the major techniques that are relevant to container orchestration security.Learn more:

As the move to the cloud enables a more secure 
hybrid workforce, organizations are also increasing their dependency on cloud storage services. They require effective threat protection, mitigation strategies, and tools in place to manage access to their cloud storage. For example, Azure Defender treats data-centric services, such as cloud storage accounts and big data analytics platforms, as part of the security perimeter and provides prioritization and mitigation of threats for data storage. As Microsoft cloud security researchers examined the attack surface of storage services, they noted potential risks to be aware of when deploying, configuring, or monitoring a storage workload. We’ve produced a threat matrix for storage
102 to 
help organizations identify gaps in their defenses. We expect the matrix to dynamically evolve as more threats are discovered and exploited, and techniques can also be deprecated as cloud infrastructures constantly progress toward securing their services.

Data 
Digital transformation and tech intensity103 have led 
to exponential data growth, and organizations are 
dealing with never-before-seen volume, velocity, and variety of data. This growth, combined with increasingly remote workforces and cloud migrations, has created a complex data sprawl often pitting security and regulatory requirements against the access business needs to deliver value from that data.
Data governance is an integral 
part of data security
Organizations that effectively manage the lifecycle 
and flow of their sensitive data as part of their business operations make it that much easier for data security and compliance teams to reduce exposure and manage risk.
As valuable as data is to organizations, data value can drop faster over time than the risk associated with it.
104 Accumulating sensitive data through 
management neglect is not only wasteful from a storage perspective but it can also be a recipe for accumulating risk. In a rapid data growth environment, it is not difficult to envision that data governance will increasingly have an impact on data security.
There is a lot to be learned and reused from recent privacy initiatives. Successful organizations with mature privacy processes have inherently had to combine data governance and security to minimize their privacy data footprint and surface of attack to achieve sustainable compliance. These security and compliance benefits can also be achieved by using similar approaches with other sensitive or regulated datasets.
Reducing the risk associated with data is not only about pruning old data and securing it where it resides now. It is also about reevaluating how the organization conducts business with sensitive data going forward to ensure proper storage, access, flow, and lifecycle so that this sensitive data does not persist or propagate uncontrollably. 
Over time, this means reengineering high-risk business processes and adhering to data governance and security principles as organization evolve their applications and infrastructures or take on new business ventures.

People 
Helping people adapt to new ways of working 
is key to any successful transformation. While 
organizations are empowering people to work 
securely when, where, and how they want, we have 
found the most successful are the ones who are also 
empathetic to the end-user experience.  
The previous sections of this chapter have presented 
a view of the threat landscape across the six 
foundational pillars of Zero Trust, with key steps 
we recommend taking to protect them. However, 
it is imperative to remember that every step we 
take to implement Zero Trust strategies impacts the 
people within the organization—and that successful 
implementation depends as much on them as it 
does on the systems and tools we put in place. How 
companies engage with their workforces around 
remote work and security matters. We conclude 
the chapter with a discussion about people, the 
human element of any enterprise, and ultimately our 
greatest asset. Some guidance about insider 
risk in the hybrid workplace 
As described in this report’s sections on Zero Trust, it 
is possible to give employees seamless information 
access while mitigating the risk of inadvertent leaks. 
Regarding more malicious insider threats, using a 
framework of common factors and patterns typically 
seen helps to enable proactive detection. Microsoft’s 
Insider Risk program has adapted numerous preventative and detective controls that decrease 
risk through all stages of the insider threat attack 
path. In general, we should assume that the threat of 
loss to the organization or its stakeholders increases 
as an attack progresses down the path. Preventative 
controls such as awareness trainings that instruct the 
organization where to report insider threat concerns, 
or controls designed to limit risky behavior (such as 
limiting the ability for those leaving the organization to share files) are both initiatives that Microsoft has 
undertaken to mitigate risk. As organizations work 
toward increasingly advanced capabilities in the 
preventative control space, appropriate stakeholders 
from across the organization should always be 
consulted. For example, before implementing any 
preventative controls, verify with the business that 
protections still enable employees and contractors  
to perform their legitimate business activities.
Insider threat attack path105
Insider threat attacks share several common factors and patterns, which can be described in a critical-path 
approach. Identifying indicators across phases of the critical path can help to enable more proactive detection.

The Insider Risk program leverages a variety of 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and signature- or rule-based detections, including those from our Insider Risk Management solution, to accomplish detection goals. While AI and ML are incredible tools that help to decrease some of the noise associated with traditional rule-based alerts, it is critical that the organization has the appropriate people with the “tribal knowledge” of business-acceptable behavior in the correct roles to create trustworthy AI and ML models. This human input takes standard supervised or unsupervised ML a step further in predicting which alerts are the most actionable for incident response teams. Lack of this knowledge can create a pool of noisy alerts with limited investigative value. Key considerations for insider threat detections

The empathy imperative
Flexible work is here to stay and with that comes 
several challenges and stressors. Teams have 
become more siloed this year, and digital exhaustion 
is a real and unsustainable threat. One in five global 
survey respondents say their employer doesn’t care 
about their work-life balance.106 Fifty-four percent 
feel overworked. Thirty-nine percent feel exhausted.  
And trillions of productivity signals from Microsoft 
365 quantify the precise digital exhaustion workers 
are feeling.
A positive corporate culture mitigates risk
A recent study out of CyLab, Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Security and Privacy Institute, found 
that negative deterrence actions like employee 
constraints, monitoring, and punishment don’t work 
to reduce insider risk.107 What does work: putting 
employee engagement, connection, and well-being 
front and center.To support the well-being of your people, it’s 
important to create channels and mechanisms to 
listen to their concerns, providing an opportunity 
to give and receive feedback and embrace 
collaboration. Taking a holistic, purpose-built 
approach that can pull signals together into a 
cohesive view across an organization provides a 
better understanding of the relevant trends in the 
organization and better risk reduction. For this 
reason, organizations are turning to ML to uncover 
hidden signs of workplace risk such as inappropriate 
communications, threatening behavior, or actions 
that would negatively impact employees and the 
business. By identifying patterns and violations, 
technology can flag risk while intervention is still 
possible, while continuing our commitment to end-
user privacy.Learn more:

INTRODUCTION:  Critical attention required on the increasing  
sophistication and scope of disinformation
ERIC HORVITZ, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER
Disinformation  refers to the deliberate use of false information with the intention of influencing public opinion. 
Efforts to fabricate falsehoods for the purposes of manipulating the masses have a long history. However, new 
forms of disinformation have come to the fore over the last decade, enabled by advances in computing methods 
and infrastructure that have transformed the power, scope, and efficiency of disinformation campaigns. 
Widely used consumer platforms and services, such as social media, creator platforms, search engines, and messaging 
services, now provide state and non-state actors with powerful channels for distributing disinformation. Beyond 
channels, these services provide malevolent actors with ready-made tools to experiment, monitor, iterate, and 
optimize the impact of disinformation campaigns. 
Commercial online platforms have been harnessed by 
these actors as engines of disinformation to power 
messaging programs aimed at political influence, 
polarization, and chaos. Disinformation strategies are 
growing in sophistication, including the concerted use of 
multiple services108 to reinforce messages across platforms.
On a second front, advances in machine learning (ML) 
and graphics have led to widely available tools for 
fabricating high-fidelity audiovisual content, referred 
to as synthetic media and deepfakes. For decades, 
photos and comments by political leaders have been manipulated or taken out of context in disinformation 
efforts, often with dramatic effects. However, technologies 
for generating deepfakes are providing malevolent actors 
with powerful, general palettes for fabricating behaviors 
and events. These methods are injecting new powers of 
persuasion into disinformation campaigns.
In a third area of concern, artificial intelligence (AI) 
methods can be used by state and non-state actors to 
formulate and drive powerful psychological operations 
that leverage insights and data about human 
cognition. ML and reasoning can be used to profile individuals and groups and to generate personalized 
programs of disinformation aimed at influencing 
beliefs, opinions, and actions.
The repurposing of consumer computing 
infrastructure, use of tools for generating synthetic 
media, and harnessing AI to guide psychological 
operations are troubling separately and in synergy. 
Together, they are supercharging disinformation, 
with grave implications for the health and vibrancy of 
democracies that depend critically on educated and 
aware citizenries.THESE

What might we do in the face of these 
developments? 
We need to critically attend to the increasing 
sophistication and scope of disinformation—and to 
engage on multiple fronts. First and foremost, we 
need to invest deeply in modern media literacy, to 
educate people about how to understand, expect, 
and recognize disinformation and misinformation. 
Work on media literacy extends beyond education 
and includes efforts to provide new kinds of tools 
that can help people to critique the source and 
veracity of news and information. Second, we need 
to support high-quality journalism, including trusted 
news organizations. It is essential to have committed 
reporters on the ground to see, hear, and report with 
clarity on events and incidents. In addition, we need 
to assure the health and vibrancy of local journalism.
On the technical front, there is promise in applying 
AI pattern recognition technologies to detect patterns 
of communications and content that reveal an intent 
to deceive. Such work includes efforts to identify 
audiovisual and text-based media as fabricated. On 
another front, efforts in networking technologies can be aimed at identifying primary locations 
and organizational sources of disinformation. 
Finally, there are promising developments with 
technologies that employ a set of methods, including 
cryptography, security, and database technologies in 
production tools and pipelines that serve to certify 
the origin and history of edits to online media 
content, referred to as the provenance109 of the 
content. Exciting progress with media provenance 
and authenticity is being nourished by strong cross-
organization collaborations.
We are facing unprecedented disinformation 
campaigns and related cyber operations by state 
and non-state actors. These campaigns target public 
awareness and knowledge with disinformation, while 
others target enterprise operations and confidence. 
It is important to stay aware of developments and 
to come together to address the challenges with 
awareness, technologies, and policies. Addressing 
the new and evolving challenges will take ongoing 
investments, innovation, and activity on multiple 
fronts. This important chapter reviews some 
of these challenges and provides insights on 
directions forward.Disinformation 
as an emerging 
threat 
Disinformation has been a steadily evolving method 
of information warfare, most recognized in the 
United States after the 2016 election, but well-
known globally since the Cold War. This approach 
is high-stakes and effective for creating social 
discord, increasing polarization, and in some cases, 
influencing the outcome of elections. Nation state 
actors with geopolitical aspirations, proponents 
of radical ideologies, violent extremists, and 
economically motivated enterprises can manipulate 
online narratives with easy and unprecedented reach 
and scale, creating significant societal impact.The general motive to spread disinformation is 
to damage the reputation of an entity, mislead 
consumers about the information, or influence 
the outcome of a proscribed event. It is one of the 
greatest threats to democracy, open debate, and 
free and modern society.
Commodity cloud computing, open-source research, 
AI tools and algorithms, and the speed and scale of 
social media have created a perfect storm for the 
rise of disinformation and malicious synthetic media 
popularly dubbed deepfakes.110 AI techniques to 
create hyper-realistic digital falsification, also known 
as deepfakes, include manipulated audio, video, 
images, and text, which will seriously challenge 
our ability to discern truth from falsehood. In this 
report, we use the term “deepfake” as AI-generated 
manipulated media used for malicious purposes. 
Mapping the problem
109A promising step forward on disinformation – Microsoft On the Issues110 Despite its popular usage, this term technically refers to a specific type of 
ML (a process by which exposure to large and diverse amounts of data allows a computer to improve its own performance) that uses layered neural 
networks (computer processors connected in a way that mimics how information travels in the human brain) to enhance the accuracy of the ML 
algorithms. Deepfakes use two algorithms: the first algorithm creates a video, and the second one tries to determine if the video is real or not. If the 
second algorithm can tell that the video is fake, the first algorithm tries again, until the resulting image looks sufficiently believable.                112TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

In the attention economy, websites and platforms 
earn revenue from the time users spend on 
them. This advertisement-based business model 
incentivizes recommendation engines and curated 
timelines with clickbait headlines and scandalous 
news, opinions, and falsehoods. The timeline 
curation algorithms give rise to creating echo 
chambers, filter bubbles, and unintentional tribalism. 
Because of echo chambers and filter bubbles, 
users predominantly see the content that matches 
their beliefs, biases, and desires, reinforcing their 
confirmation bias and filtering out opposing 
viewpoints.  Nefarious actors misuse the attention 
economy and take advantage of the advertisement 
business model to manipulate social media 
narratives to create divisions and sow discord.
“Filter bubbles” and “echo chamber”
In the attention economy, users are increasingly exposed only to information that matches 
their preferences (blue areas in the graphic). Filter bubbles represent algorithms that choose 
content based on the user’s previous search histories and other online activity.Parallels in cybersecurity
Cyberattacks compromise the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of digital systems. The 
difference between a disinformation attack and 
a cyberattack is the target; disinformation is also 
an attack and compromise of our cognitive being. 
While cyberattacks are exploits of computer 
infrastructure to create disruption, disinformation 
exploits human infrastructure (our inherent 
cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and psychological 
vulnerabilities), and the attack compromises logical, 
analytical, and critical thinking.
We can therefore think of the threat posed by 
disinformation and computational propaganda 
as cognitive hacking . A cognitive hack attempts 
to change the target audience’s thoughts and 
actions using disinformation to manipulate the way 
they perceive reality. Nefarious actors accomplish 
cognitive hacks utilizing various techniques, 
including manipulating, mis-contextualizing, or 
misappropriating information. Ultimately, these 
hacks can create social discord, exacerbate polarization, influence election outcomes, disrupt 
democratic principles, enable financial fraud, and 
threaten life and property.
Both disinformation and cyberattacks are used by an 
adversary to achieve disruption. A well-coordinated 
disinformation campaign can fill the broadcast 
and social channels with false information and 
noise, creating narratives that play with emotions 
and drown out the true narrative. This maneuver 
is similar to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attack that floods the target services and networks 
with superfluous requests to connect and overload 
the system to prevent legitimate requests from 
being fulfilled. Disinformation can also be used 
for social engineering threats on a mass scale. Like 
phishing attacks to compromise IT systems for 
data extraction, disinformation campaigns play on 
emotions, giving cybercriminals another feasible 
method for scams. Deepfake videos and audio 
can trick employees into releasing or sharing login 
credentials, which can then be used to gain access 
to an enterprise’s network.Deepfakes 
Deepfakes are photos, videos, or audio files 
manipulated by AI in hard-to-detect ways. The 
weaponization of deepfakes can have a massive 
impact on an economy and national security. 
By eroding public trust in the media, deepfakes 
undermine the credibility of journalism. As this 
credibility is eroded, deepfakes also give rise to the 
“Liar’s Dividend” phenomenon. In an environment 
where it is unclear what is real and what is fake, it 
becomes easier to discount any inconvenient or 
unpopular truth as fake. As an example, deepfakes 
could enable a public figure to claim that their real 
actions are just a fake.
The proliferation of deepfake technology can directly 
harm individuals. Deepfake pornography has been 
used to objectify and victimize people without 
consent, especially women or those who identify 
as women. This revenge pornography is now a 
significant problem: over 96% of deepfake videos                 113are nonconsensual pornography.111 A person’s 
reputation can be damaged beyond repair by a 
single deepfake video posted to social media. 
Criminals can and will take advantage of AI and 
deepfakes to increase the effectiveness of scams 
and other nefarious activities. We have seen recent 
examples of business112 and romance113 fraud using 
audio deepfakes. Even after effectively debunking 
the deepfake, the damage remains. Deepfakes 
also present direct threats to society. Nefarious 
nation state actors work around the clock to spread 
disinformation campaigns, which increasingly 
include deepfakes, to create ideological conflicts in 
democracies around the world. They have effectively 
used disinformation and empowered domestic 
actors to disrupt elections and undermine efforts 
to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Technology 
innovations like replacing video codecs with deep 
neural networks are making it easier to create 
deepfakes in live video calls.TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS

Microsoft Research, in coordination with Microsoft’s 
Responsible AI team and the Microsoft AI, Ethics 
and Effects in Engineering and Research (AETHER) 
Committee, continues to develop technology 
for training and testing deepfake detection 
technologies.Mitigation 
through media 
literacy
Pew Center Research indicates that people are 
increasingly concerned about their ability to 
discern false information and sift through the 
volume of information they encounter in their daily 
lives.114Media literacy is one of the most effective 
tools available to improve individual resilience to 
disinformation.  From helping people understand 
minor editorial corrections, to preventing fake news 
from gaining traction, and reducing the likelihood 
that foreign influences undermine an election, media 
literacy inoculates individuals by helping them think 
critically about information they encounter.
Even a short intervention with media literacy 
education has been shown to make a significant 
difference in understanding disinformation, 
identifying the motivations and context, and 
reducing belief in inauthentic content.115 News 
media organizations, technology companies, universities, and social media companies have all 
started to implement media literacy efforts, which 
include resources such as labeling, contextualizing, 
providing further reading or resources, and even 
gamified tools like online quizzes.
Improving media literacy is vital to addressing 
disinformation. Interventions should be contextualized 
and tailored to the audience, starting from a young age 
with curriculum for responsible digital citizenship 
incorporated into standard civics education. Some 
US states, most notably Florida and Ohio, have 
already started piloting and developing media 
literacy curriculum in classrooms.116 In Finland, when 
the country was targeted with foreign influence 
operations and disinformation campaigns by Russia in 2014, the government introduced multi-platform 
information literacy and strong critical thinking as a 
core component of a national curriculum.117
Media literacy curriculum should help individuals 
understand information they encounter, evaluate 
the plausibility, verify the source and search for 
other reputable sources on the topic, and interpret 
context. In today’s online world with essentially 
limitless information available, these skills may 
not be intuitive, but are certainly ones that can be 
learned and sharpened over time. Further, media 
literacy education does not need to be confined to 
the classroom: these skills are universally relevant, 
especially for digital nonnatives, or anyone who 
regularly consumes news and information online.

Microsoft has and continues to develop media 
literacy resources to help consumers discern information. Ahead of the US 2020 elections, we released two online quizzes, “Spot the Deepfake”
118 
and “Know My News,”119 aimed at raising 
awareness about synthetic media technology and understanding news sources. It also released a “VaxFacts Quiz”
120 to heighten awareness around 
COVID-19 misinformation as vaccines were becoming more widely available. Microsoft has also developed a hybrid threat training curriculum that highlights how threat actors are increasingly using cybersecurity and disinformation attacks in tandem to accomplish their goals. These training modules have been customized for the political community, including political campaigns, parties, and government entities, as well as for journalists and human rights organizations.

as an enterprise  
disruptor
Disinformation traverses a social diffusion chain 
comprised of both intentional and unsuspecting agents. Intentional actors include hackers, disruptors, and other agents that generate or propagate disinformation. These agents could include nation states targeting a society, industry, or social arena. They could also include agents engaged in corporate counter-espionage activities or anti-competitive disruption. Unintentional agents might include personnel, vendors and suppliers, other partners and stakeholders, customers, and even competitors that continue the propagation of disinformation, often not realizing what they are doing. They concurrently become victims and unsuspecting agents of disinformation. Through these agents and other means of information dissemination, a parallel and concurrent wave of disinformation traverses or envelops the enterprise. This wave can be simple and anticipated, like the rise of a tide, or it can have the effect of an unpredictable tsunami about to weigh down on an unsuspecting coastal village. In this case, the coastal village would be the enterprise information community. Like its disruptive effect on social discourse, such disinformation carries with it the potential to disrupt corporate decision making, create commercial confusion and discord, and sow doubts in the minds of employees, customers, and markets. The following three areas cover some of the more common considerations that enterprises could prioritize to ensure preparedness to mitigate the disruptive effect of disinformation.
1. Parallel to its effect through social media, disinformation has made its way into enterprise workflows that are dependent on data collection, aggregation, and distribution practices. These workflows and data practices may be automated or manual in nature, and even more advanced practices, such as those leveraging AI capabilities, are prone to breach. Sophisticated AI algorithms can be fooled, or their underlying models overwhelmed by excess disinformation and other types of information attacks, leading to erroneous or anomalous insights and outcomes. In general, automated practices face the threat of breach and corruption in the absence of adequate detection, timely notification, isolation and eviction, and defense in depth. In contrast, manual practices, such as copy/paste, swivel chair (entering data into one system and then entering the same data into another system), screen-scraping, and aggregation of public information through human evaluation and automated means, are also prone to disruption, corruption, or nuanced modification. To address this growing threat, enterprise decision makers should evaluate which of the enterprise’s critical information gathering and distribution processes could benefit from more resilient practices. Which inflection points, or points where information is interchanged or interpreted, need more rigor, controls, or other forms of checks and balances? Based on this analysis, controls and even out-of-band crosschecks and validations should be introduced to mitigate the threat of polluted or mischaracterized information that could potentially corrupt the data stream and subsequent insights that are derived from the data.
2. Signals and data within the enterprise could be compromised through security vulnerabilities or attacks and infused with disinformation. Instrumentation and threat signals for performance of enterprise resilience are often seen as having secondary importance and are therefore not given the level of scrutiny that core or primary services or applications receive. Data and signal collection are sometimes relegated to supporting applications and systems that are bolted on as 115
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021adjunct environments. Attackers and disruptors 
know this and strike where they believe weaknesses could exist. Their primary areas of reconnaissance include operational security and control systems alongside discovery of code and configuration vulnerabilities, especially within secondary or supporting systems. Successful attacks could disrupt threat signals, or infuse misleading data, if they are able to bypass intrusion detection. Enterprise decision makers should reevaluate the scope and security of their protected assets and associated instrumentation and signals and ensure that intrusion detection perimeters around core or critical assets have been set to encompass these areas as well. This review includes evaluation of controls that measure the effectiveness of network segmentation, validate adherence to data and signal classification schema, inbound and outbound traffic features and patterns, classification of data and dependencies, and instrumentation that ensures data integrity as it traverses across systems, at rest and in backups. Instrumentation and signals that evaluate and indicate the performance of critical systems should be cataloged and put through a security and operational review for vulnerabilities and possible causes of compromise and injection of disinformation.3. Situational intelligence could be supplanted with disinformation or nuanced in ways to generate bias or create doubt in the minds of decision makers or front-line personnel. Situational intelligence includes threat intelligence, crisis intelligence, disaster data, and other types of information that helps to increase an enterprise’s understanding of 
 
an operating or competitive environment.  
One of the key strat
egies of disruptors is 
to supplant situational intelligence with disinformation. This strategy is often deployed in environments that are considered out-of-band or beyond the control and reach of the enterprise, including social and other media platforms, public sites and portals, and other types of campaigns that could target the enterprise or its complex and myriad supply chains. Disruptors sometimes generate so much out-of-band disinformation that it overwhelms facts and otherwise accurate data. Their disruption tactics go beyond the enterprise and its direct information, extending often to suppliers and third-party affiliates. Their goal is to introduce doubt in the minds of decision makers and/or front-line personnel. Disinformation that could disrupt suppliers, logistics, deliveries, orders, and fulfillment poses threats to the supply chain and confidence in product and resource availability. TO

The imp act of diminished confidence could 
drive higher pricing and impact production costs. Doubt in the enterprise’s ability to maintain a grip on prices, supplies, and suppliers could exacerbate disruption and force accelerated timelines or induce imprecise or incorrect decisions. Alternatively, it could introduce latency or doubt in decisions, such as recovery, failover, or fallback. Disruptors could also try to diminish front-line confidence in leadership by corroding confidence or by presenting false or inaccurate information and leading or trailing indicators. Enterprises that are dependent on external sources of intelligence for critical functions need to be vigilant about information they ingest or consume. Information gatherers and decision makers need to validate sources and have means of cross-checking intelligence. Rating systems and schema should be used, and the veracity and provenance of the intelligence needs to be confirmed independently.

Recommendations: Four-point 
plan for enterprise executives  
As enterprises develop and mature their capabilities 
to respond to information disruption and 
disinformation, there are new imperatives that are 
emerging in the areas of security controls, threat 
classification, and analysis. To support and enhance 
the enterprise’s ability to improve its response, 
prioritize mitigations to address the highest risks, 
and to make investments that propel or accelerate 
its corporate objectives, the following practices 
could be leveraged as a starting point to develop 
sustainable mitigations and improvements to 
counter the effects of information disruption and 
disinformation.
1. Catalog enterprise exposures to disruption, 
manipulation, and disinformation.  
Enterprises should begin with the arduous task of 
cataloging or keeping track of disinformation attacks 
on their information systems and data. This catalog 
would be an addition to the catalog of threats and 
attacks that are part of enterprise security controls.
• Include a classification of information 
manipulation and disinformation with clear 
indicators of targeted outcomes and impact of 
the attacks.
• Note the sources of the attacks or information 
leading to their origins and motivation, if 
known.• Categorize and record the content that was 
manipulated or introduced so that patterns can 
be determined or detected.
• Determine the means of propagation and 
diffusion through the enterprise.
• Identify characteristics of actors and agents to 
the best ability that is available at the time.
• Conduct candid and objective identification of 
corporate functions, processes, and systems 
that consumed or were impacted by the 
disinformation.
The net impact of the disruption or information 
infiltration must be evaluated and eventually 
included in considerations of corporate liability. 
2. Assess the impact of manipulation or disinformation. 
 
An emerging area for enterprise management and 
human resources is to conduct impact analyses of 
disruption and disinformation. Managers and human 
resource departments should study the behavior 
of enterprise employees, partners, and customers 
as they reacted to disruption or interacted with 
disinformation. Security and data science teams 
should run A/B tests on AI and trained algorithms to 
ensure they have not been corrupted or their models 
tampered with. Finance teams and economists could 
look at the costs of disruption, including opportunity 
cost, and the liabilities associated with impact of 
market confidence, revenue, growth, and operational 
cost increases associated with disinformation.3. Quantify the consequences of disruption.  
By examining dependency maps of data flow, 
analysis, and the points at which humans and 
systems were impacted, enterprise leadership 
can estimate or calculate the consequences and 
collateral damage caused by disinformation and 
disruption. The goal of such an examination is to 
quantify the blast radius of any potential disruption 
and assess its severity on enterprise operations, 
functions, and reputation. The likelihood and 
impact of such disruption should be used to inform 
investment in mitigations and controls and help 
prioritize safeguards that need to be implemented 
to give the enterprise the most appropriate 
defense against the impacts of disruption and 
disinformation.
4. Assess privacy implications of disruption.
Disinformation and information disruption 
campaigns sometimes attack or threaten customer 
and other protected data, which can have significant 
privacy implications for enterprises. Primary sources 
or stores of such data are difficult targets as they are 
kept deep inside the defensive network of controls, 
intrusion detection, and layers of authentication and 
authorization. Modern enterprise controls include 
Zero Trust approaches and tightly controlled or 
restricted access to data that is subject to privacy 
regulations, controls, and guidelines. Sovereign 
rules and obligations might also apply. It is under 
such constraints and restrictions that enterprises 
are expected to provide data resiliency, including hot and cold backups, or active-active models of 
redundancy or concurrency. Information disruptors 
and attackers aggressively search for backup 
facilities, dormant data stores, or unattended data 
and data services that are slated to be deprecated. 
When they find a weakness in security controls, 
not only do they threaten breach of data but their 
actions can also trigger potentially impactful privacy 
incidents. Enterprise privacy and security teams must 
take a closer look at controls, including security 
measures, encryption at rest and in transit, of 
primary data sources and any backups or alternate 
data stores. Gaps in these environments and 
controls must be reported to enterprise leadership 
and prioritized to be addressed in a timely manner.TOC    INTRODUCTION     THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    DISINFORMATION

Campaign  
security and  
election integrity
Threats to democratic processes from cyber-enabled 
interference are a critical concern. Microsoft has shut down dozens of websites widely attributed to nation state actors that have been used to target elected officials and candidates, democracy-promotion organizations, activists, and the press. We’ve also seen attempts by nation states to target and exploit key building blocks of democratic systems, including voting systems and political campaigns. We also endured the calculated manipulation of social media platforms in efforts to sow misinformation and disinformation.
The Defending Democracy Program at Microsoft was created to advance technology, increase cyber resilience, and engage with government, campaigns, and democratic stakeholders to address threats to democratic processes from cyber-enabled interference. In partnership with the rest of the Microsoft Security community, the Defending Democracy team has helped protect two major US elections and dozens of national elections around the globe. This unique and important issue space raises an interesting set of cybersecurity insights, challenges, and solutions that we must address to ensure that our democratic institutions remain secure.Unique cybersecurity 
challenges in political campaign security
The structure and lifecycle of political campaigns 
present unique cybersecurity challenges. Campaign organizations comprised of a mixture of staff, volunteers, and consultants are often created and expanded rapidly once an individual declares their candidacy. As a result, team members are often asked to use their own personal devices, including cell phones or laptops, throughout the campaign. Further, with constrained budgets and limited IT expertise, decisions about which email and file sharing provider to use are more likely tied to personal preference than extensive security and risk evaluations. With people regularly joining and leaving a campaign and utilizing a variety of personal devices to conduct campaign business, it becomes difficult to manage and enforce strong cybersecurity practices.
These realities expose political campaigns to significant cybersecurity threats, compounded further by the asymmetric advantage that malicious actors maintain in terms of sophistication, resources, and capacity. Political campaigns are high-value, high-visibility targets, but may have as few as one person dedicated to cybersecurity for the organization. 
It is critically important that we in the security community continue to raise awareness of cybersecurity issues and best practices within political campaigns. This can be as simple as establishing strong communication channels between campaign staff and the private sector to ensure they have a point of contact if issues arise. It is also imperative for candidates to establish a culture of cybersecurity within their campaigns, not just among the IT staff but inclusive of everyone who interacts with the campaign. Relatively easy actions such as turning on multifactor authentication (MFA), utilizing a password manager for strong unique passwords, and using secure communication channels for campaign communications make a tremendous difference in improving the resilience of the entire organization.
Microsoft has developed a service to address the challenges associated with campaign staff using personal devices and accounts for campaign business. Microsoft AccountGuard
121 is a security 
service that unifies threat detection and notification across all accounts, and is available at no cost to campaigns utilizing Microsoft 365 products. When a campaign enrolls in AccountGuard, they can also extend coverage to anyone who interacts with the campaign, including staff, volunteers, interns, consultants, and more. The service then provides notification and remediation guidance in the event of a nation state threat or compromise on campaign-related accounts. The service currently protects over 40,000 accounts for political customers, including political campaigns, political parties, technology vendors, and elections departments.Heading into the US 2020 Presidential election cycle, the AccountGuard program also offered enhanced identity protection features and resiliency reviews to customers involved in the election. Organizations that took advantage of these resources saw an average increase of 18% to their Microsoft Secure Score. In addition to political customers, the service is available to other high-risk groups including human rights organizations, journalists and media organizations, and healthcare organizations.

Threats to election infrastructure
As the Microsoft security community partners across 
the public and private sectors to secure election 
infrastructure, the differences between how cloud 
and on-premises systems are used in elections 
becomes clear, as well as the various types of 
election technologies that must be secured. We form 
our threat models around three main categories of 
systems, each with unique security considerations 
and risk profiles.
Globally, voting systems are statutorily required to 
be always disconnected from the internet and are 
effectively “air gapped” systems. Though this poses 
certain challenges for maintenance and updating 
devices, it acts as an extremely effective mitigation against remote threat actors. Though some form of 
connected or online voting systems are starting to rise 
in popularity, they remain in the minority of systems.
Securing election systems
UPDATES AND PATCHING 
The primary recommendations for elections 
officials and private vendors who support elections 
IT is to have a comprehensive strategy to patch 
systems regularly and keep software up to date, 
and to use MFA.  This is particularly relevant to 
any internet-connected systems, such as election 
support technologies and back-office IT systems. 
During the lead-up to the 2020 US election cycle, 
the ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472122) was 
announced, less than three months before the election. This event served as a good reminder that 
vulnerabilities can be announced at inopportune 
moments, and the security of an environment relies 
on the ability to apply patches rapidly. Customers 
who were using cloud infrastructure were secured 
against this vulnerability significantly faster—often 
automatically and immediately—than those running 
on-premises servers that needed to be patched.

• Vote tabulation devices (paper ballot scanners)

• Information portals
• Not regulated, connected to the internet, shared ownership    Highest risk
Election back-
office IT• Voter information portals
• Day-to-day workstations and server infrastructure
• Email and filesSHARED  SERVICES 
Unlike a private sector company that is typically in 
charge of their entire IT estate, local governments 
tend to share IT systems with their state, regional, 
and national-level counterparts. Although this can 
be cost effective and beneficial from a management 
perspective, it spreads out the risk of cyber intrusion 
from an unrelated government organization into an 
elections department. For example, if a research lab 
at a state-run university were compromised, because 
of shared IT systems attackers could move laterally 
to attack a county election’s voter information 
portal. Furthermore, responsibility for maintenance 
and security is often split between private service 
providers and local governments. Sharing services 
highlights the need for network segmentation 
wherever possible to limit the impact of a cyber 
incident that either starts within or could migrate to 
an elections organization.
There are many 
connected components 
of an election beyond 
just casting a ballot at 
the polls—from data 
integrity concerns, 
to disinformation, to 
protecting election 
officials’ online identities. 
While many of these 
things may be invisible 
to the average voter, 
each offers a potential 
pathway for an 
adversary to attack the 
integrity of an election.

SMALL TEAMS AND SMALL BUDGETS
In some countries, including the United States, 
elections are not managed federally; each 
municipality is responsible for running and 
managing its own elections infrastructure. The 
asymmetric threat of advanced adversaries 
targeting local-level elections offices that are time 
and resource constrained is of real concern. As 
discussed earlier in this report, advanced persistent 
threat actors have IT knowledge and monetary 
resources that exceed the annual budgets of local 
municipalities. Therefore, steps must be taken by 
both the private and public sector to concentrate 
cybersecurity talent and resources in a way that 
helps to offset and balance that asymmetry.
To help elections organizations address these 
concerns, the Defending Democracy team focuses 
heavily on securing and supporting customers using 
cloud services to support their elections, in both the 
private and public sectors. Our goal is to use the 
cybersecurity expertise at Microsoft to offset the 
asymmetric threats faced by local elections or small 
elections vendors.

 (5/06/2019)Election integrity
To address growing concerns in voter trust among 
election systems, and to help drive forward 
principles of software independence, election 
auditability, and security and cryptography, 
Microsoft has developed and launched a project 
called ElectionGuard. Microsoft ElectionGuard 
is a free open-source software development kit 
designed to make voting systems more secure, 
auditable, verifiable, and efficient. This is done by 
implementing principles of end-to-end verifiability 
and answers the question: How can I trust the 
accuracy of an election outcome if I worry that the 
software, hardware, transmission infrastructure, or 
personnel responsible for conducting the election 
could be untrustworthy?
Unlike banking software or other high-security 
industries, secret ballot elections require that an 
individual’s data (votes) must be a secret to all 
parties, and there can be no direct tie between 
a person’s identity and their vote, other than the 
acknowledgment that a voter has cast a ballot.
ElectionGuard implements these end-to-end 
verifiable features:
• Enables every individual to verify that their 
vote is included in the final election tally,  
with a unique verification code.
• Ensures that no one specific individual’s vote 
can be revealed.• Cryptography guarantees that no votes can 
be changed after being cast without being 
detectable.
• Ensures that no one specific individual’s vote 
can be revealed.
• Provides assurances that the system is recording 
votes properly and not “changing votes.”
• Allows interested third-party watchdog 
organizations to verify that the tally was 
summed properly, and that the system 
operated without errors.

should not exist in a vacuum, and independent 
security researchers should be able to validate the integrity of the software. To that end, we have implemented a bug bounty program where Microsoft will award the security community for finding vulnerabilities in the ElectionGuard software. Since launching in October 2019, the program has awarded tens of thousands of dollars in bounties to researchers across multiple continents. In this way, security issues were discovered and responsibly reported by the community, all patches were issued within 90 days of reporting, and potentially vulnerable code was never used by voters in production election systems. Public trust in elections is, in part, dependent on the independent auditability of the systems and processes that support our elections. We continue to welcome the trained eyes of security researchers across the world to suggest improvements to the service and to independently test ElectionGuard’s security and cryptography.

(microsoft.com)Countermeasures needed
To ensure access to credible information and preserve freedom of expression, we need a multistakeholder and a multimodal approach. The main objective of any countermeasure is to mitigate the negative societal impact of disinformation. 
Specifically, when it comes to malicious synthetic media, the approach must be twofold: (1) to reduce the exposure to malicious deepfakes, and (2) to minimize the damage it can inflict.
Media literacy efforts can be enhanced to cultivate a discerning public. Deepfakes will have a limited adverse impact if media consumers use logical thinking and common sense to differentiate between fiction and reality. Deepfakes have such a potentially devastating impact because many individuals assume that a video, a photograph, or an audio is real if it aligns with their preconceptions and biases. Alternatively, often people believe it’s fabricated if it contradicts their beliefs.
We need meaningful regulations and appropriate laws to govern disinformation and deepfakes so that, at the very least, the perpetrators are held accountable. Without legislation and legal remedies, people are vulnerable to disinformation campaigns and deepfake revenge pornography, fraud, and other harms. Of course, legislation must take a balanced approach toward freedom of expression and speech.The technical countermeasures are not simple. The synthetic media’s technological development continues to outpace what is possible by algorithms and other technologies. Technical solutions for deepfakes fall into two categories: (1) detection and authentication and (2) provenance. Detection of deepfakes and disinformation is difficult. Human-AI collaboration can help, but context, cultural differences, and intent make it hard to decipher disinformation objectively. In the long term, provenance solutions will help. Media authentication, authoritative content, and standards akin to SSL/HTTPS for web traffic must be developed for media. Technology that can help “sign” the media to find the media publisher, machine-readable fingerprinting, and watermarking technology to tamperproof media would reduce media manipulation to effectively combat the spread of deepfakes.

INTRODUCTION:  Five cybersecurity paradigm shifts
ANN JOHNSON, CVP , SECURITY, COMPLIANCE & IDENTITY
In working with organizations from around the world, we recognize the need to enable people to work 
productively and securely and from a variety of non-traditional locations and a variety of devices. Through 
these interactions, we’ve learned a lot about the role that cybersecurity plays in helping organizations maintain 
business continuity as we adapt to a hybrid work world. As a result, we anticipate five cybersecurity paradigm 
shifts that will support the evolution of work in a way that centers on the inclusivity of people and data.
1. The rise of digital empathy 
When we consider building security into the 
productivity experience, there can be a tendency 
to focus on security from purely a technology 
perspective. However, during times of constant 
disruption and change, when people are 
susceptible to increased stress reactions, the 
importance of digital empathy comes into 
greater focus. Digital empathy involves thinking 
about the ways in which people behave and 
engage with technology. In this way, sociology 
and humanities considerations are essential to 
the evolution of technology and cybersecurity.
 Empathy isn’t just for in-person interactions. 
By applying empathy to digital solutions, w e 
can make these solutions more inclusive. In 
cyber security, that means building tools that 
accommodate more diversity with respect to people and their ever-changing circumstances, 
their diverse perspectives, and varied abilities. 
For example, rather than requiring people to 
do unnatural things to engage with security, 
which can also increase their likelihood of 
getting distracted when busy, factoring in 
digital empathy leads to inclusion of security 
professionals with a broader range of abilities, 
skill sets, and perspectives—for greater diversity 
and effectiveness of cybersecurity solutions. 
It also means developing technology that can 
forgive mistakes. 
 Digital empathy will be critical to how we 
move forwar d as an industry. Whether it’s an 
organization—or an individual—our ability to be 
empathetic will help us t o understand and adapt 
during times of constant change. 2. The Zero Trust journey is becoming 
increasingly important 
Zero Trust is an “assume breach” security 
posture124 that treats each step across the 
network and each request for access to resources 
as a unique risk to be evaluated and verified. This 
model starts with strong identity authentication 
everywhere. Multifactor authentication (MFA)—
which we know  prevents 99% of credential 
theft125—and other  intelligent authentication 
methods126 make accessing apps easier and more 
secure than traditional passwords. 
 As we look past the pandemic to a time when 
workforces and budgets r ebound, Zero Trust

3. Diversity of data matters 
Microsoft tracks more than 24 trillion daily 
signals from a diverse set of products, services, and feeds around the globe. We were able to identify new COVID-19-themed threats—sometimes in a fraction of a second—before they reached customers. This is just one example of how the power and scale of the cloud has a clear advantage when it comes to combating threats.
 As one example, in the last y ear, the diversity of 
data also allowed us to understand COVID-19-themed attacks in a broader context. Microsoft cyber defenders determined that adversaries were primarily adding new pandemic-themed lures to familiar malware.

4. The resiliency of a business is tied to its 
cyber resilience 
Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are deliberately targeting core business systems to maximize the impact of the attack or likelihood of a ransomware payout. With this context, we know a comprehensive approach to operational resilience must include cyber resilience.
128 At 
Microsoft, we benefit from a strategy that focuses on four basic threat scenarios: Planful events such as weather incidents, unplanned events such as earthquakes, legal events such as cyberattacks, and pandemics like COVID-19. Cloud technology helps organizations develop a comprehensive cyber-resilience strategy and makes preparing for a wide range of contingencies less complicated due to its scalability.
5. A greater focus on integrated security 
The first half of 2021 brought into stark reality the agility and callousness of our adversaries. To uncover shifting attacker techniques and stop them before they do real damage, organizations must be able to see across their apps, endpoints, network, and users. Facing a new economic reality, organizations will also be driven to reduce costs by adopting more of the security capabilities built into their cloud and productivity platforms of choice. To maximize the effectiveness of security organizations, tools must be fully integrated to improve efficacy and provide end-to-end visibility.
 
While digital acceleration will continue to influence the paradigm shifts that shape our industry, one thing remains the same; security technology is fundamentally about improving productivity and collaboration through secure and inclusive user experiences. Summary of 
report learnings 
What became clear as we compiled this report is 
how much technology is now baked into everything we do. We can’t afford to treat technology and cyber risk as something separate and contained that IT and security teams are left to manage on their own. The examples in this report show that criminals will seek to exploit whatever technology we develop and introduce; the challenge is in understanding what form that will take. Because we can’t always predict how technology will be exploited, we need to assume that anything we create or use will be a potential target and prepare ourselves to be as resilient as possible.
The key actionable learning from all the elements of this report is that to minimize impact of attacks we must truly practice good cyber hygiene, implement architectures that support the principles of Zero Trust, and ensure cyber risk management is integrated into every aspect of the business.  
The following section summarizes some of the key learnings reinforced by the findings and insights in the report.

Cyber hygiene
Taking basic security precautions can help 
your organization prepare for and mitigate the 
overwhelming majority of modern cyber threats 
and helps to prepare for the evolution of threats 
as technology advances. The “cybersecurity bell 
curve” shows the activities that will have the biggest 
impact on reducing threats. Some of those actions, 
the impact they have, and recommendations for 
implementing them are described here.
Enable multifactor authentication
This continues to be the top recommendation as it 
was last year. MFA can stop credential-based attacks 
dead in their tracks. Without access to the additional 
factor, the attacker can’t access the account or 
protected resource. The introduction of passwordless 
technology and architectures makes this easier for 
employees and customers to use and also provides 
more security than traditional text (SMS) or voice 
approaches. MFA should be enabled on all accounts 
that support it, in a way that it is easy for all users 
to use it. It’s also important to ensure that people 
understand that they should not approve an MFA 
request unless they were trying to log in or access a 
system—many people automatically click to approve 
any pop-up that they receive. Digital empathy can 
be useful in understanding this behavior and helping 
to nudge people toward less risky decisions.Apply least privilege access and secure the most 
sensitive and privileged credentials
When attackers breach an organization, they look 
for privileged credentials to provide them with 
access to sensitive information and systems. In 
addition to using MFA to protect login to an identity 
and ensuring that they have least privilege to access 
systems, the credentials that support that identity 
and provide access must be secured. Among other 
things, this will help to minimize the impact and 
breadth of pass-the-hash-style attacks in the event 
that malicious code is already running on a local 
machine or network. This includes securing hardware 
such as with a trusted platform module or hardware 
security module or using cloud authentication 
services that provide credential protection. 
Separate accounts should be used for privileged 
access versus general internet and email access. 
Dedicated hardened workstations should be used 
for privileged accounts and to perform privileged 
tasks to prevent the chances of infection through 
general internet activity and email. Using JIT/JEA 
systems ensure they will only get exactly the rights 
needed to perform a task and only for as long as 
needed to undertake it. This should be combined 
with risk-based adaptive policies that deny access to 
resources when there is any doubt over the hygiene 
of the account or device.Secure and manage devices (keep up to date)
An essential part of good cyber hygiene is 
ensuring that devices are kept up to date and 
configured correctly. Use endpoint management 
software to enforce policies that ensure the correct 
configuration settings are deployed and that 
systems are running the latest software. Wherever 
possible, take an evergreen approach to ensure all 
devices are constantly running the latest version 
of software. This includes ensuring a means of 
updating every piece of software or application so 
that there are no dependencies that prevent you 
from implementing the latest updates and patches. 
For those devices missing critical patches, restrict 
them from accessing sensitive resources.
The same approach should be taken for cloud 
services, using cloud security posture management 
to ensure that systems are configured correctly. 
Keeping software and systems up to date can be 
easier in the cloud where update domains enable 
migration to updated infrastructure for testing with 
the option to roll back easily if issues occur. 
For systems, such as OT, where updating software is 
not as easy, a strong inventory of systems is needed 
to understand which equipment exists, and how 
vulnerable it may be to certain attacks. Incorporate 
add-on modules or replace hardware to ensure it 
achieves all seven properties of secured devices.  In systems where this is not possible, the 
environment should then be protected from other 
systems and monitored to detect any unexpected 
traffic or attempts to compromise the systems.
Use antimalware and workload protection tools 
Antimalware and detection and response technologies 
should be deployed across the ecosystem to prevent 
attacks and provide warning of any anomalies 
or threats that may be attempting to breach the 
environment. This includes OT and IoT environments. 
For cloud systems, workload protection should be 
deployed across all systems from virtual machines 
and containers to machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
databases, and applications.
Protect data
Good cyber hygiene as outlined in the previous 
four steps can protect data, but it is also important 
that organizations know which sensitive data they 
have, and ensure that they have appropriate steps in 
place to protect it. In fact, there is often a regulatory 
requirement to do so. The General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR), for example, requires a risk-
based approach to protecting the data of residents 
of the European Economic Area (EEA). To take a 
risk-based approach it is important to know your 
data—to understand what is sensitive and what may 
be subject to regulatory requirements. While there 
have been standards for data governance and data         126protection for over 30 years, many organizations 
have struggled to implement them. As we move 
into a world where we increasingly collaborate and 
share data, it’s important to ensure we understand 
what data we have, classify it accurately, and apply 
sensitivity labels as appropriate. This practice will 
enable us to use information protection and data 
loss prevention technologies to protect data with 
more confidence.TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS
Introduction Summary of report learnings Conclusion
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
In the event of a breach, these practices can also 
help security teams to know where the most sensitive 
data is and whether it was exposed to attackers.
Adopt Zero Trust principles
This report has highlighted the sophistication and 
complexity of many of the attacks we are seeing and 
why it is increasingly difficult to prepare to counter 
these attacks. Zero Trust is important to reduce the 
exposure of sensitive data by limiting the inherent 
trust within an organization that an attacker would 
exploit—especially when people are connecting 
from everywhere and will not necessarily be coming 
from a “trusted” location. This is why adopting a 
Zero Trust approach is now a top priority for most 
organizations. In a world where it’s harder to predict 
or prevent the attacker, it’s important to assume they 
will get in and limit their exposure.Isolate legacy systems
Not every system is capable of running the tools to 
enable Zero Trust. For example, many operational 
technology (OT) systems have long technology 
lifecycles and may run operating systems and 
software that can’t be updated.
Network segmentation should be used to restrict 
access to these systems. This can help to ensure 
that operational technology is not exposed to the 
risks from hybrid working, and that IoT devices and 
sensors have access and connections only to the 
smart ecosystems they support.
This means that rather than trying to run the 
modern and legacy alongside each other, we can 
isolate these systems from exposure to the risks 
that come from a modern connected infrastructure 
and avoid having that legacy technology hold back 
modern architectures. It also allows monitoring of 
the environment that hosts operational technology 
and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to be highly 
focused on detecting and responding to unusual 
activity in an environment where it may not be 
possible to install software on the system.Integrate cybersecurity into 
business decision making
Now that technology is an essential element of 
business operations—a process that has only been 
accelerated over the last 18 months—cybersecurity 
must be a factor in overall business decision 
making and not just something that is left to the 
technology department.
Treat cyber as a business risk
Cybersecurity should no longer be viewed as a 
specialized risk that falls only within the purview 
of the IT department. Technology expertise sits 
in the IT department, just as expertise in financial 
risk management generally resides in the finance 
department, but ultimate responsibility and accountability for the risks lie within the business 
function. As the chapters in this report illustrate, 
addressing the threats that we face require a mix of 
technology, policy, and people expertise—as does 
all business decision making.
Every leader in the organization should consider 
how they enable employees and customers to have 
a better digital experience, while also considering 
what’s needed to mitigate the associated risks. This 
includes consulting the cybersecurity team on how 
to manage the risks that arise as they undergo 
digital transformation. As this report shows, there 
are inherent risks in all the new technologies and 
business practices we adopt, and those risks must 
factor into any decisions about technology, policy, or 
business practices.

Introduction Summary of report learnings Conclusion
Microsoft Digital Defense Report  |  October 2021
Security decision makers should truly embrace a 
risk management mindset as they consider how the steps they take can protect the organization, while also helping achieve operational goals. 
Resilience includes 
cybersecurity
In the connected world we live in today we need 
to consider resilience as a key success factor in everything we do. Digital transformation is bringing increasing complexity to our security solutions including greater collaboration with third parties and the expectation that systems will be available 24x7. The platforms we are building to support businesses 
need to be fully resilient against attacks.  
Cybersecurity and resilience should be considered together. Operational resilience planning should include understanding the cybersecurity threats to the system and making appropriate investment to ensure continued success.
It is crucial to implement strong backup and 
recovery solutions, but it is equally important that organizations plan for how operational decisions will be made in the event of a cyberattack and practice their crisis management and response as well as their technical response to incidents.Build a third-party 
risk program 
Partners, suppliers, and contractors interact with 
data and applications connected to our corporate environment all the time. Attackers are increasingly targeting third-party providers to gain access to their systems and networks with a view to gaining access to their customers.
Ensure that the organization has a strong supply 
chain assurance process, built on an understanding of your suppliers’ exposure to cyberattacks, how they configure their systems to be secure, and what steps they take to protect any information you share with them. Ensure that you are managing your third-party risk through robust service-level agreements, attestations, and shared assessments like SSAE 18 SOC 1 and SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and ISO 20001.
Third-party access to systems should also follow 
the Zero Trust principles you apply to your own organization to limit exposure to attacks originating from a compromise of their systems.Use digital empathy in 
implementing security controls  
As we connect more and more systems together, 
security can become more complex, but we need to ensure that we value diversity of skills, areas of expertise, work and learning style, and background, among other things. Do not expect or require everyone to be technology experts, in the traditional sense of the term, in order to engage with the security of these systems.
When you implement security controls, apply 
digital empathy to ensure that the controls you are providing consider the environment in which those using the system are working and allow them to easily engage with the environment. For example:
Invest in user training that educates and informs.
Implement security training that helps employees understand the risks they face and the best way they can help to protect the organization. This training should be ongoing and designed in a way that increases engagement. User training is not just a compliance activity but an essential part of the early detection and response to an attack. Ensure that the training you provide explains risks in the context of the employees’ work, and provide the context and tools they need to understand appropriate behavior, recognize attacks, and report unusual activity. A culture of enablement, trust, and engagement will significantly improve reporting and provide earlier warning of attacks. 
Build security into productivity.
When you implement security controls, think about the impact on the experience of those using it, whether employees or customers. What is their background, expertise, and cultural experience? Any controls you put in place should consider the experience of those who do not have a background in technology. Is it intuitive, can it be understood, and does it fit into their workflow as naturally as possible? Too much friction without an understanding of why a control is in place can lead people to circumvent technology or ignore processes to get things done. 
If, in addition to training people, we ensure that 
security fits into their working practices rather than those of a technology or cybersecurity professional, we increase the chance of their understanding the risks and taking the appropriate actions. Where possible, cybersecurity should be invisible to the user except where it can help nudge them to take appropriate actions to manage risk.

Conclusion
As technology becomes more integral to our society, 
attackers are increasingly seeking to exploit this 
cultural shift. From cybercriminals to nation state 
groups, these are sophisticated and well-researched 
organizations with the resources, investments, and 
research to deploy complex and well-informed attacks 
against an organization. They are professional 
enterprises with their own sophisticated supply chains 
and their own well-researched, well-engineered lures 
that seek to exploit the way your organization works.
As we increasingly do more of our work online, so do 
criminals and nation state attackers. You must take 
this realization into consideration as you plan digital 
activities. For any new venture, consider the threat 
alongside the opportunity, and think about how you 
can manage risk for your entire organization.
This kind of thinking will require fundamental 
changes in the way we operate. We must consider 
risk as a whole and across the organization, rather 
than within siloes or individual viewpoints. We must 
look at where we need to change the way we work, 
and where we need to do the things we are already 
doing—but better.A number of key themes arise throughout the 
different sections of this report that we encourage 
you to consider as you think about improving your 
security posture:
• Do the basics well.  
A running theme throughout many of the 
chapters is that, although attackers are 
becoming more sophisticated, good cyber 
hygiene and implementation of basic security 
measures is often the best way to disrupt, 
prevent, and detect their attacks. 
• Take a holistic view. 
Too often the way we organize security and risk 
is driven by our own organizational structure 
and siloes. Attackers will look for vulnerabilities 
across these siloes, so we need to consider risk 
and the best approach to mitigating risk at an 
organizational level. This may require some 
standardization or translation of approaches 
across the different teams in an organization. 
It also underlines the importance of standards 
as we seek to harmonize between companies, 
which is increasingly important to managing 
supply chain risk. • Any element can be used as an attack vector. 
Attackers will look for the weakest link across 
an organization’s ecosystem, so we must 
manage it holistically. The weakest link may be 
a connected freezer or building management 
system that is used to gain access to the 
corporate network, or it may be a user or device 
that is compromised via a phishing email in 
an attempt to gain access to the operational 
technology running a factory or production 
plant. We need to consider and manage the 
organization’s entire attack surface.
• Think about people.  
People engage with technology and can be 
used as a way of gaining access to the digital 
environment. Think about how to engage with 
them in a way that will help them to understand 
the risks they face. Understanding, engaging, 
and educating people will allow them to 
become a key line of defense against modern 
threats, whether that is misinformation seeking 
to influence peoples’ decisions and undermine 
democracy or phishing emails seeking to gain 
access to and compromise an organization’s 
digital assets. • Zero Trust is an architectural principle. 
The threats we have seen underline the 
importance of Zero Trust in designing and 
managing the risk in an organization. The last 
year has emphasized why there should be no 
such thing as a trusted application, trusted user, 
or trusted device with unrestricted access. The 
risk and context of every connection needs 
to be considered before allowing access to 
resources. Zero Trust is not a technology but an 
approach to managing risk. When implemented 
properly, it can enable us to unlock the 
potential of modern technology while limiting 
our exposure in a hyperconnected world.          TOC   INTRODUCTION    THE STATE OF CYBERCRIME    NATION STATE THREATS    SUPPLY CHAIN, IOT, AND OT SECURITY    HYBRID WORKFORCE SECURITY    DISINFORMATION    ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS    TEAMS
