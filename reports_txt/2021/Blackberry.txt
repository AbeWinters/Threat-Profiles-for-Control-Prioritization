INTRODUCTION
The BlackBerry 2022 Threat Report is not a simple retrospective of the cyberattacks 
of 2021. It is a high-level look at issues affecting cybersecurity across the globe, 
both directly and indirectly. It covers elements of critical infrastructure exploitation, 
adversarial artificial intelligence (AI), initial access brokers (IABs), critical event 
management (CEM), extended detection and response (XDR), and other issues 
shaping our current security environment.  
This report covers topics confronting individuals and organizations around the world. 
As always, it represents our unique piece of the overall security puzzle. Our goal is 
to improve the global security posture by sharing our information, predictions, and 
experiences with everyone. To accomplish that, the report examines 2021’s major 
security events and how they may shape the cybersecurity landscape going forward. 
It provides a deep dive into the cybersecurity issues we face today, and offers readers 
additional information and context to perform their own thoughtful analysis.  
That said, readers expecting our annual breakdown of the top 10 malware attacks 
witnessed by BlackBerry over the past year will not be disappointed. Nor will those 
who look forward to our incident response (IR) year in review, annual cybersecurity 
legislative updates, and near-term predictions. Many of the sections our readers have 
come to enjoy from previous BlackBerry threat reports have returned. In addition, this 
year, we tackle supply chain attacks, dangerous new programming languages, security 
in the Metaverse, quantum computing, ransomware campaigns, and other relevant 
emerging topics. 
The fluidity of modern cyberattacks can require organizations to frequently rethink 
their approach to cybersecurity and consider new options. They must constantly 
assess new technologies and approaches that can outperform legacy antivirus 
(AV) solutions, ranging from prevention-first AI to adopting Zero Trust architecture. 
Accordingly, the BlackBerry 2022 Threat Report offers suggestions on cybersecurity 
strategies and technologies that could have prevented the greatest security lapses  
of the past year.  
We sincerely hope the information contained in this report will help protect users and 
keep organizations secure in 2022 and beyond.

2021’s major security 
events and how 
they may shape 
the cybersecurity 
landscape going 
forward. 04BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The most widely publicized cyber events of 2021 involved ransomware attacks on 
critical infrastructure and technology companies. The ransomware threat group REvil 
attacked Acer, JBS Foods, and others while DarkSide crippled Colonial Pipeline and 
Avaddon infiltrated AXA. In short, the scope and success of various threat groups 
last year–particularly against private sector companies considered part of national 
infrastructure–proved unsettling. Governments responded to the attacks, with G7 
countries and NATO allies putting cybersecurity at the top of the public policy agenda. 
U.S. President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order on “Improving the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity”, while the Department of Justice established a Ransomware and Digital 
Extortion Task Force. 
As the year wore on, a Microsoft® Exchange Server zero-day vulnerability spiraled 
into a crisis after the HAFNIUM group exploited the flaw. Other threat actors were 
quick to capitalize on the opportunity by reverse engineering the patch and targeting 
organizations worldwide. The swift proliferation of HAFNIUM-style attacks reinforced 
the importance of both organizations and individuals keeping software up to date. 
However, updating software as a reactive practice cannot save the initial victim of an 
attack–aka, the “sacrificial lamb”. This has many organizations looking to alternative 
security approaches like the Zero Trust framework, XDR, and prevention-first AI.  
At the end of 2020, a supply chain attack against SolarWinds made international 
headlines. The same style of attack reemerged in 2021, when Kaseya’s VSA software 
was compromised, ultimately affecting over 1,000 businesses. Supply chain attacks 
often rely on the trust already established between providers and customers to 
propagate–offering another strong case for adopting a Zero Trust framework. While 
attacks on large organizations dominated the 2021 news cycle, small to medium-
sized businesses (SMBs) also suffered countless attacks, both directly and through 
the supply chain. BlackBerry threat researchers discovered SMBs averaging 11 to 13 
threats per device, a number much higher than enterprises. 
Threat actors owe their success in 2021 to a variety of factors. Many have learned 
to adopt and mimic private sector capabilities by using service providers such as 
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and malware-
as-a-service (Maas) to leverage malicious attacks. Others have created a layer of 
obfuscation between themselves and their targets by using IABs and impersonating 
other threat groups. New programming languages were exploited to some effect, with 
Go, D, Nim, and Rust making appearances across the threat landscape. Cobalt Strike  
remained active as a pivotal tool for command-and-control networks to proliferate 
malware and attacks. 05BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
Progress was made on integrating security into connected vehicles with the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE), and the United Nations (UN) providing firm guidance to automakers. 
Mobile apps remained notoriously insecure. The vulnerable SHAREit app, which 
allowed remote code execution, was downloaded over one billion times. Recent 
studies found 63% of tested mobile apps use open-source code known to be 
vulnerable. Adding to smartphone users’ woes, SMS phishing (smishing) attacks were 
up 300%  in North America over the last year. 
The cyberattacks of 2021 affected people at every level, from large organizations to 
individual cellphone owners. BlackBerry’s internal reporting shows every industry is 
open to cyberattacks. The same cybersecurity issues that threaten non-profits are 
also risks for transportation companies, public organizations, utilities, healthcare 
organizations, financial institutions, etc. It reminded us that no one is safe. When 
it comes to cyberattacks, there is zero immunity. However, there are a number 
of cybersecurity innovations and approaches offering stronger protection to 
organizations. For example, organizations seeking effective new security measures 
should consider adopting a Zero Trust framework. They could also use prevention-first 
technology, migrate to an XDR platform, or engage a managed XDR team.  300%

These well-known attacks made national or international news due t o their 
considerable scale, sophistication, ruthlessness, or ransom demands. However, their 
stories do not tell the true toll cyber crime took upon public and private organizations. 
The cyberattacks of 2021 hit multiple industries, affected organizations of all sizes, 
and serve as stark reminders that no one is safe. There is zero immunity from 
dedicated threat actors, and anyone operating in the digital space may be targeted 
next. With malicious hacking attempts occurring every 39 seconds , an organization 
will exhaust itself relying on reactive security measures. Fortunately, prevention-first 
tools, predictive AI technologies, and Zero Trust frameworks can offer organizations 
an effective alternative to traditional cybersecurity solutions. 07BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT

Finding Beacons 
in the Dark: 
A Guide to 
Cyber Threat 
IntelligenceCOBALT STRIKE 
No threat report would be complete without at least a passing mention of Cobalt 
Strike. This year, BlackBerry collated insights and trends from an internal dataset of 
over 7,000 Cobalt Strike Team Servers and 60,000 Beacons. 
Tracking and monitoring Cobalt Strike Team Servers that are deployed in the wild 
can greatly assist the threat intelligence lifecycle. Doing so provides invaluable 
information for fine-tuning security solutions and aiding with incident inv estigations. 
A detailed breakdown of threat intelligence gained from analyzing Cobalt Strike can 
be found in The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team’s new eBook, 
“Finding Beacons in the Dark: A Guide to Cyber Threat Intell igence” .  
Our annual review of Cobalt Strike activity begins with some of the most interesting 
stats involving Team Server deployments. 
For example, observe the top 10 autonomous system numbers (ASNs) and netblocks 
(ranges of consecutive IP addresses) responsible for hosting Cobalt Strike’s 
immensely versatile Beacon payload. This reveals a fascinating trend: Threat actors 
are increasingly likely to use legitimate cloud providers for hosting. This allows the 
malware operators to conceal their traffic from monitoring systems, which makes the 
task of automated blocking trickier. Adding to detection difficulties, several large and 
reputable companies are found in the top 20 list of providers. Figure 1 shows the top 
10 ASNs found hosting the Cobalt Strike Beacon:

payloads from Team Servers. These ports are typically open in most environments, 
making them an obvious choice for routing command-and-control (C2) traffic. 
Cobalt Strike Beacons are highly configurable through their use of Malleable C2 profiles, 
which specify how a Beacon acts and looks in the target environment. These profiles 
also specify what parameters are used within their communication protocol and the 
method that Beacon uses to inject into other processes. The top 10 Malleable profiles 
observed throughout 2021 are shown in Figure 5. 
Using Malleable C2 Profiles, Cobalt Strike Beacon can be configured to perform a 
technique called domain fronting . This is used to route HTTPS traffic via trusted third-
party content delivery networks. The top 10 hosts used for domain fronting in 2021 were:

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT Figure 7 - Top 10 DNS redirector IPs used by Cobalt Strike Figure 8 - Spawned processes created for Cobalt Strike injections Cobalt Strike Beacon can be configured to use DNS redirectors to forward C2 traffic 
to a Team Server. Figure 7 shows the top 10 DNS redirector Internet Protocols (IPs) 
from 2021.
Cobalt Strike Beacon spawns processes and then injects dynamic-link library payloads 
into them. These processes can be configured to work on different architectures (x86/
x64) through the SPAWNTO option. The default process, and most popular choice, is 
rundll32.exe. Refer to Figure 8.
In addition to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates deployed on the Team 
Server, Beacons are also bundled with an additional SSL public key. This is part of 
a public/private key pair that is generated on the server whenever someone installs 
Cobalt Strike. The public key is subsequently embedded in all Beacons generated  
on the same server and used for C2 check-ins. It is important to note that this key  
pair is entirely different from the SSL key pair used for the HTTPS certificate on the  
Team Server. 
Unlike watermarks, the SSL public key stored within a Beacon’s configuration offers 
a fantastic means of clustering Beacons. It is virtually guaranteed that the keys are 
unique per Team Server installation, but are often reused, for example via virtual 
machine redeployments. In other instances, threat actors will use a single Team 
Server to configure payloads for deployment from other servers within their control. 
This makes spotting, tracking, and monitoring their infrastructure considerably easier.

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT The top 10 SSL public keys mostly belong to leaked builds of Cobalt Strike Team Server: 
Finally, it is possible to track Team Server builds via a configuration setting called 
PROCINJ_STUB. It contains a message-digest algorithm (MD5) hash of the 
Cobalt Strike Java archive (cobaltstrike[.]jar). This archive contains the server-side 
component that provides the Team Server operators with a graphical user interface  
to generate, operate, deploy, and control Beacon payloads. 
The MD5 hash of the cobaltstrike.jar package allows us to determine several things. 
By correlating it with its corresponding Java archive commonly found in online 
malware repositories such as VirusTotal, we discover: 
 • The exact version of the Team Server used 
 • Whether the Team Server in operation is a leaked, cracked, or a trial version 
 • If the Team Server is a private, licensed version 
Even if the Java archive is unavailable to assist with version identification, it is still  
an extremely valuable clustering mechanism. This is especially true in the case of 
private and customized builds.JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC0%50%60%

in May 2021 . Their document includes a list of recommendations users and 
organizations can follow to minimize exposure to this threat.
SUPPL Y CHAIN ATTACKS 
Supply chain attacks are not a recent concept. However, the software supply chain has 
been increasingly used as an attack vector in recent years. Why is this the case? For 
one, the potential impact and spread of a supply chain attack can be far greater than 
that of targeting an individual victim. The potential for damage varies depending on 
the customer base of the product. The relation between producer and consumers is 
essentially one-to-many, with a single point of failure. This means that the larger the 
customer base, the larger the potential attack base, too. 
Threat actors know exploiting the trust people place in the integrity and security of 
their supply chain is easier than compromising fortified targets. Adversaries typically 
look for the path of least resistance; the supply chain represents the latest evolution  
in their tradecraft. dd4c91e0e6d9bbf6eefdd84284d67a3fb54afe01ec6a75edf35e1a44f8bd3929b2736f1cbba90d42286fc42bfba74f4d - 4.3a56c813864af878a4c10083ca1578e0a - 4.0a49f5445f01a9f3240eea9e46ee66c81 - 4.3

WHAT IS A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK?
Figure 11 - Topological view of a supply chain attack 
To better understand supply chain attacks, see the topological representation of 
company interactions in Figure 11. Supply chain attacks occur when an organization 
relies on a third party for part of their product development, hardware, software, or 
other services. 
The U.S. Department of Defense defines a supply chain risk  as one where the 
adversary may “sabotage, maliciously introduce unwanted function, or otherwise 
subvert the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, 
operation, or maintenance of a system to surveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise degrade 
the function, use, or operation of such systems”.  
Take another look at Figure 11. The central organization depends on Vendors A 
through C for different requirements. All is well until Vendor C is breached and a 
foothold is established in their environment. Vendor C’s product development lifecycle 
is compromised and a malicious component included in their product. 
The product, in its compromised state, is distributed to the organization where it 
serves as a foothold for malicious adversaries to infiltrate and compromise.  
Once attackers are inside, all information they can access may be exfiltrated, 
including product information, financial information, and personal information. If the 
compromised organization has a weak security posture, further propagation of this 
attack may spread to linked organizations and their customer base.

POTENTIAL IMPACT 
Depending on the size of the compromised organization’s customer base, the impact 
of a supply chain attack can be huge. 
Determining which customers have been affected, and to what extent, can prove 
difficult. As a result, as soon as a breach has been identified, customers should be 
notified so they can begin their own remediation efforts. Organizations should plan  
for the worst in these scenarios: assume that their customers have been breached and 
the danger of further reputational damage is imminent. The longer it takes for threat 
disclosure and response, the greater the risk that attackers gain a persistent foothold 
in customer environments. 
There is also the possibility of a knock-on effect, where if the breach is not contained, 
other linked organizations can be affected too. 
RECENT SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS 
Supply chain attacks sound dangerous, and they are. The prospect of a trusted  
source being the initial point of compromise is one that many prefer to believe  
will not happen, but it does. Some examples of historical software supply chain 
attacks include: 
 •  The NotPetya ransomware attacks in 2017.  Attackers compromised the Ukrainian 
tax software MEDoc and caused billions in damages to pharmaceutical giants. 
 •  The SolarWinds breach in 2020.  The Orion IT Management and monitoring 
software was compromised and pushed out to a number of high-profile entities .  
 •  Kaseya in 2021.  A zero-day exploit allowed attackers to deploy an update to every 
customer running their Virtual System/Server Administration (VSA) software. The 
update was pure ransomware, and it encrypted a large portion of Kaseya’s VSA 
customer base. 
The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity recently published a report  studying  
24 supply chain attacks from January 2020 to July 2021. The report revealed some 
stark statistics: 
 •  Suppliers either did not know or did not report how they were compromised in  
66% of supply chain attacks. 
 •  Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups were credited with carrying out 50%  
of supply chain attacks. 
 •  Exploiting trust in the supplier accounted for nearly 62% of attacks on cust omers. In 24 recent supply 
chain attacks, 
advanced persistent 
threat (APT) groups  
were credited with 
carrying out 50%  
of them.50%16
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT HOW DO SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS EVADE DETECTION? 
At its core, a supply chain attack is an abuse of trust. A trusted supplier or vendor is 
assumed to maintain rigorous security standards. For example, an analyst responding 
to alerts showing C2 network traffic may have a bias based on their level of trust in an 
application. They may see a particular domain of interest in the network traffic, or its 
SSL certificates. However, as it comes from a trusted application, the threat indicator 
is assumed to be legitimate.  
This bias serves to highlight the benefits of a Zero Trust approach, and how implicit 
trust can be a major vulnerability. It also reinforces the need to investigate and more 
thoroughly vet third-party applications. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link:  
If one part breaks, the whole system can fail. 
HOW CAN BETTER PROTECTION BE ACHIEVED? 
Many security issues can be addressed through taking a holistic approach to security 
and adopting the principles of Zero Trust. All threat vectors need to be covered, 
including sources usually trusted as benign.  
An organization’s product security incident response team (PSIRT) is likewise a key 
component of improving its security posture. For example, a PSIRT can work closely 
with other teams, communicating valuable security insights to them throughout the 
software development lifecycle (SDLC). As its inclusion in the SDLC continues, the 
PSIRT will reach new levels of maturity and become more proactive. This helps ensure 
that the products and build processes are as secure as possible. The risk of a supply 
chain attack is reduced when the lines of communication between teams are  
well-formed. 
For security analysts, it is important to reduce one’s natural bias in favor of trusted 
applications and services. While certificate signing, provenance, build tooling, 
and other steps that can be taken have security value, it is imperative for security 
operations (SecOps) teams to always remain skeptical. Rapid disclosure and 
containment of a breach is likewise critical for protecting organizations and the 
customers that rely on their products or services. 
LOG4J/LOG4SHELL EXPLOITS 
Log4j  is an open-source logging package used by countless applications and major 
frameworks, including Apache Struts2 . Toward the end of 2021, a vulnerability in this 
software component that attackers can exploit by sending specially crafted text was 
discovered. Attacks targeting this vulnerability, also called Log4Shell exploits, allow 
threat actors to fetch code from a remote server and perform remote code execution 
(RCE). Since Log4j is not malware, it is not susceptible to cybersecurity measures and 
tools exclusively focused on detecting malicious code.  Many security issues 
can be addressed 
through taking a 
holistic approach to 
security and adopting 
the principles of  
Zero Trust.17
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT The Log4j vulnerability, first reported  by Chen Zhaojun on November 24, is further 
described in CVE-2021-44228 . On December 10, the vulnerability was publicly 
disclosed in the National Vulnerability Database, maintained by the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology ( NIST ). Revelation of this vulnerability led to a swift 
increase in attacks that quickly numbered millions per hour . 
The Log4j vulnerability is particularly troublesome, as it is difficult for organizations  
to know which applications and services are at risk. A standalone application using 
Log4j may be easy to identify, but what about cases where the package is six levels 
deep in the dependency chain? The widespread use of Log4j paired with the complex 
nature of software dependencies indicate this vulnerability will present a threat for 
years  to come. 
While anti-malware measures are not useful for detecting and remediating the Log4j 
vulnerability, other cybersecurity strategies can reduce an organization’s exposure 
to this risk. For example, adopting a Zero Trust  framework can limit an attacker’s 
use of the vulnerability by restricting the access of exploited processes. Zero Trust 
environments can further reduce risks by enforcing least-privilege access  polices 
throughout the environment. Also, as many cyberattacks rely on delivering a malicious 
payload, anti-malware tooling may ultimately prevent file-based attacks resulting  
from the exploit.  
OLD DOGS NEW TRICKS–OBSCURE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 
The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team  has been tracking and 
monitoring the threat landscape for the appearance of four obscure programming 
languages: 
 •  Go •  D  
 •  Nim •  Rust  
These languages are currently being observed to track their use and adoption by threat 
actors. Selection of these languages was partially driven by an uptick in their misuse 
for malicious activities. Another factor is their increasing role in malware families 
authored and uncovered within the overall threat landscape.  
Generally, new programming languages are often developed to improve on various 
aspects or shortfalls in current ones. This, consequently, also makes them an 
attractive option for abuse by threat actors. New languages can be used as a wrapper 
or loader for an existing malware family, to rewrite existing malware, or develop  
brand-new malware. This trend has been seen in the past with the use of VB6 and 
Delphi to develop wrappers for then-current malware.  Old Dogs, New Tricks: 
Attackers adopt 
exotic programming  
languages
18
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT More recently, in March 2021, the BazarLoader malware family was rewritten in the 
Nim programming language and dubbed Nimzaloader. Several months later, in May, 
RustyBeur  appeared, which was a variant of the Buer-loader malware rewritten in Rust.  
From a threat actor’s perspective, the use of exotic programming languages provides 
many advantages. These include: 
 •  Enhanced performance  
 •  Lack of available analysis tooling  
 • Analysts’ unfamiliarity with their composition 
 •  Increased ability to thwart signature-based antivirus detection  
It could be argued that these languages act as a layer of obfuscation. Their newness 
and the lack of available analysis tooling means they can look rather alien to 
inexperienced researchers. 
BlackBerry observed these languages being used in the development of an increasing 
number of droppers and loaders. They were used as new, first-stage pieces of 
malware designed to drop/decode, load, and deploy commonly seen commodity 
malware families. Threats currently using these new languages include the Remcos 
and NanoCore remote access trojans and Cobalt Strike Beacons.  
Many of these languages can also be cross compiled to target multiple operating 
systems. This powerful feature has been abused relentlessly by threat actors. 
Specifically, the Russian-based APT29 group and their Wellmess malware, which was 
written in Go and compiled to target both Windows® and Linux® operating systems. A 
further example of this was the appearance of ElectroRAT  malware in January 2021. 
It was also developed in Go and then cross-compiled to target all major operating 
systems–Windows, macOS®, and Linux. 
Nim and Go have been used in different parts of the same attack chain to enhance the 
attacker’s detection evasion capability. For example, threat group APT28 leveraged a 
Nim-based downloader to retrieve a Go-based payload in its Zebrocy malware. 
The benefits and popularity of these languages have resulted in an uptick in their 
adoption by the security community. Due to their offensive advantages, they are of 
particular use in the development of Red Team tooling. In late 2020, FireEye disclosed 
that a threat actor had gained unauthorized access to some of its Red Team tools. 
As a countermeasure, they released a statement along with a GitHub repository  
comprised of various detection signatures to help identify the stolen tools. Within this 19
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT repository, FireEye revealed that its Red Team had been employing a combination of 
publicly available, modified tools and in-house custom tools. Some of these Red Team 
tools were written in DLang, Rust, and Go. 
Malicious binaries authored in these languages currently constitute a small portion of 
those being utilized by threat actors. However, their use in cyberattacks is a trend that 
is likely to increase in the coming decade. 
INITIAL ACCESS BROKERS 
The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team  has been tracking a previously 
undocumented IAB that BlackBerry has dubbed Zebra2104. Our investigation 
uncovered a mass of interlinking malicious infrastructure that showed an unusual 
connection between several seemingly unrelated threat groups. 
The first revelation came in April 2021, with the discovery of a Cobalt Strike Beacon-
serving domain that also doubled as a C2 server. By following a trail of network 
breadcrumbs, we found numerous overlaps with previously documented malspam  
infrastructure. This infrastructure served various payloads, including Dridex, over the 
past year. It was also associated with a phishing campaign targeting Australian-based 
entities, both private and government. 
Further research uncovered additional links to a MountLocker ransomware 
intrusion  in March 2021, via some shared domain registrant information for the 
domain supercombinating[.]com. More digging revealed another related domain, 
mentiononecommon[.]com, that resolved to the same IP in an alternating fashion as 
supercombinating[.]com over several months. Open-source intelligence confirmed that 
this domain had previously been tagged as a StrongPity  C2 server in June 2020. 
Promethium (aka, StrongPity) is an APT group that has been active since 2012.  
The group typically uses watering hole attacks as a mechanism to deliver trojanized 
versions of commonly used utilities. WinRAR, CCleaner, and Internet Download 
Manager are a few of the utilities that have been maliciously repurposed to distribute 
the group’s malware. 
While seeking further evidence to prove these two disparate groups cooperated 
in some capacity, our researchers came across another interesting find. A tweet 
from The DFIR Report  in August 2020 stated that additional ransomware was being 
distributed from supercombinating[.]com. This time, the malware belonged to  
Phobos family, not MountLocker.  20
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT This raised more questions regarding the connection between these threat groups. 
Were they related or just sharing the same infrastructure? Had we uncovered  
some sort of distribution system? Was an IAB the missing link binding these  
groups together?  
An IAB is an entity whose aim is to gain unlawful access into an organization’s 
network. They establish a foothold, usually by installing a backdoor, then sell their 
ill-gotten access on the dark web. Pricing for their services may range from as low as 
$25 USD up to thousands of dollars. After receiving access, buyers will often deploy 
malware within the victim environment.  
Although different ransomware groups may share infrastructure , our research during 
this investigation indicates this was not the case. In numerous instances, a delay was 
seen between the initial compromise employing Cobalt Strike and the distribution 
of additional ransomware . These factors led us to infer that the overlapping 
infrastructure is not that of MountLocker, Phobos, or Promethium. Rather, it belongs 
to a fourth group that has acted as a middleman to facilitate the operations of the first 
three. This arrangement was achieved by either providing/selling initial access, or by 
the provision of IaaS. 
Additionally, the domains found throughout this overlapping infrastructure used to 
resolve to IPs were provided by a singular Bulgarian ASN belonging to Neterra L TD. 
The fact that all the IPs were clustered together on the same ASN adds credence 
to the theory that they are owned by one threat group. This group also likely laid the 
groundwork for the other threat actors to access networks breached by the IAB. 
CHACHI 
The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team  has been tracking a previously 
unnamed Golang remote access trojan (RAT) targeting Windows systems. We’ve 
dubbed this RAT ChaChi. This RAT has been used by operators of the PYSA (aka, 
Mespinoza ) ransomware as part of their toolset to attack victims globally. Recently, 
the malware has been targeting education organizations. 
ChaChi has been observed in the wild since the first half of 2020 without receiving 
much attention from the cybersecurity industry. The first known variant of ChaChi 
was used in attacks  on the networks of local government authorities in France. It was 
listed as an indicator of compromise (IOC) in a publication  by CERT France at the time 
of the attacks. 
Since then, BlackBerry analysts have observed more refined versions of ChaChi being 
deployed by the PYSA ransomware operators. Their campaign focused on educational 
institutions across the U.S., which is evident by a recent increase in activity, as 
reported by the FBI.PYSA Love s ChaChi:

REVIL
The FBI named the Russia-affiliated RaaS group REvil  (aka, Sodin or Sodinokibi ) as 
the culprits behind attacks on the world’s largest meat supplier, JBS. These attacks 
threatened the global food supply chain and serve as a reminder of the vulnerable 
state of critical infrastructure worldwide. 
The malware acts as a RaaS, and became prolific after another RaaS group, GandCrab , 
shut down its operations. Security researchers have identified many similarities 
and code reuse between REvil and GandCrab. REvil was first advertised on Russian 
language cyber crime forums and is associated with the threat actor Unknown  
(aka, UNKN). 
REvil is most famously associated with recent attacks on the travel insurance industry, 
Acer , and computer manufacturers. Acting as a RaaS, REvil relies on affiliates or 
partners to perform its attacks. The REvil developers receive a percentage of all 
proceeds from ransom payments. Because the ransomware is distributed by different 
entities, the initial infection vector can vary. Typically, infection is achieved via phishing 
campaigns, brute force attacks to compromise remote desktop protocol (RDP), 
or through software vulnerabilities. REvil is also known to be distributed by other 
malware, such as IcedID .REvil was first

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT DARKSIDE  
The DarkSide ransomware  variant first appeared in mid-2020. It is distributed as a 
RaaS that is used to conduct targeted attacks. DarkSide targets machines running 
both Windows and Linux. It made headlines in 2021 with its attack on the U.S. fuel 
pipeline system, Colonial P ipeline .  
DarkSide uses a double extortion scheme, where data is both encrypted locally and 
exfiltrated before the ransom demand is made. If the victim refuses to pay, their data 
is published to a site located on the dark web. 
After the Colonial Pipeline attack, the DarkSide Group stated  that it did not intend to 
affect hospitals or medical facilities, education, not-for-profit, or government systems. 
The DarkSide Group was reportedly shut down  in May 2021, possibly by the U.S. 
military’s Cyber Command.

Conti ransomware  made international headlines after its initial discovery in mid-2020. 
BlackBerry researchers have observed Conti attacks against manufacturing, insurance, 
and healthcare service providers across Japan, Europe, and the U.S.  
Conti is offered as a RaaS, which is a popular way for threat actors to distribute and 
sell their malicious services via underground forums. As this threat is offered as a 
saleable service, it is customizable and thus its functionality can be altered from one 
infection to another. Threat actors released a decryptor  for this threat in May 2021, 
which can help recover files altered by a specific strain of Conti. 
Conti has seen a rise in popularity since the infamous ransomware Ryuk apparently 
ceased operations. Many analysts regard Conti as the ransomware that replaced Ryuk, 
and consider it to be one of the most troubling ransomware threats in the wild. Many analysts

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT AVADDON
The Avaddon ransomware variant first appeared in early 2020. It made international 
headlines due to recent attacks against Australian organizations and the Asia-based 
cyber insurance company, AXA . Both the FBI and the Australian Cyber Security Center 
have released warnings regarding an ongoing attack by this malware family. 
Like DarkSide  and REvil  ransomware, Avaddon also uses a double extortion scheme, 
where data is encrypted locally and exfiltrated before the ransom demand is made. If the 
victim refuses to pay, their data is published to a site located on the dark web. Avaddon, 
however, goes one step further. To further encourage compliance, attackers also subject 
victims to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack until the ransom is paid. 
After drawing attention for its role in several high-profile ransomware incidents, 
the group behind Avaddon seems to be shuttering its current operations . Law 
enforcement efforts to track down malware operators visibly increased after 
the attack on Colonial Pipeline, which likewise prompted DarkSide  to shut down 
operations. Avaddon has released the decryptors to the latest version of its threat.

Ragnar Locker ransomware made international headlines for its attacks against 
a Taiwanese manufacturer of high-performance DRAM modules and NAND Flash 
products. The first variant of this family appeared in late 2019. 
Like many other well-known ransomware variants (such as DarkSide , Avaddon , and 
REvil ), the current variant of Ragnar Locker also uses a double extortion technique  
to encourage victims to pay.  
Ragnar Locker’s dark website lists its latest victims on a self-dubbed “wall of shame”. 
The threat group currently claims to have exfiltrated 1.5TB of data from a high-profile 
victim. According to the website, this information has been stealthily gathered over  
a long period of time.
HIVE 
First seen in June 2021, the Hive ransomware family made headlines for attacking 
commercial real estate software company Altus Group . This threat also employs 
double extortion techniques. Victims refusing to cooperate with the threat actor risk 
having their data published to group’s site, Hive Leaks.  
Hive samples are written in the Go programming language and compiled for both 32-
bit and 64-bit machines. The samples themselves are UPX packed to reduce their size,

Predictive Advantage  retroactively measures the period of time an AI-driven model would 
have detected and prevented a new threat prior to its discovery. For example, if an ML 
model protects against a threat that appears one year after the model’s creation, it scores 
a predictive advantage of 12 months. The measurement uses an offline local prediction 
algorithm for testing, without any updates or an Internet connection. This ensures the  
ML model performs exactly as it did upon its original release date, without enhancements 
or upgrades. 
BlackBerry has performed a predictive advantage test to score our detections against the 
top 10 malware families described in this annual report. This illustrates how far in advance 
the AI model offered protection against the largest threats facing our customers in 2021. 
The AI model represented in this test was created in October 2015. It was deployed with 
the BlackBerry® Protect agent version 1320. The numbers in Figure 22 show how many 
months in advance our model could have protected customers from each threat before  
it was discovered.

AI AND ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS 
As the previous examples of Predictive Advantage indicate, artificial intelligence 
and machine learning can be mighty weapons in the fight against cyber crime. 
Unfortunately, they also have the potential for misuse or abuse at the hands of 
sophisticated and unscrupulous actors with malicious intent. 
Consider the case of deep learning, one of the most hyped technologies of the past 
decade. Despite its promise for industry, it also introduces another target for threat 
actors to compromise.  
DEEP LEARNING AND ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS 
Over the past decade, the rise of deep learning (aka, neural networks) has provided 
a massive boon to technical industries. This disruptive technology has enabled 
companies to improve products and optimize key performance indicators by 
uncovering patterns previously hidden in their internal data. These algorithms have 
allowed companies to reallocate manpower away from tedious analytics tasks: 
specifically, those tasks in which huge quantities of rule sets or other heuristics were 
manually generated. 
Unfortunately, this progress has come at a cost. An entire field known as adversarial 
learning has emerged as a threat to all products employing predictive algorithms. The 
primary goal of this field is to discover ways neural networks can be taught to fool 
other predictive algorithms by subtly changing input data. As an example, adversarial 
algorithms have been used to determine how to apply small patches of tape to a stop 
sign to render it invisible  to classification algorithms. For imagery or audio, adversarial 
attacks can be used to make nearly undetectable changes to a sample to fool 
otherwise highly accurate prediction algorithms. 
In cybersecurity, these algorithms have been used to modify malicious files to allow 
them to bypass both heuristic and ML-aided defenses. It is not simple to make 
arbitrary changes to files (which have their own structure and structural rules), so 
most of these attacks use a bulk iterative strategy. Using this technique, algorithms 
make thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of small additions to a file that 
individually have no impact on its functionality. However, each change can nudge 
a predictive algorithm’s decisions on threat classification in the benign direction. 
Concerningly, the files generated by these adversarial algorithms seem to be capable 
of being transferred between models. This means an attack trained on one defense 
might be capable of bypassing dozens of commercial cybersecurity products. 
In spite of the danger posed by these algorithms, the pace of research in this area 
is accelerating, largely due to misaligned incentives. Deep learning is an extremely 
competitive and popular field, giving academics and large technology companies 
strong motivation to publish as much research as possible. As a result, the field of An entire field known as 
adversarial learning has 
emerged as a threat to 
all products employing 
predictive algorithms.35BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
adversarial attacks is extremely active. For example, a search for adversarial attacks 
on Google Scholar™ for 2020 returns thousands of entries, of which a few hundred 
focus on cybersecurity.  
Similarly, ML engineers looking to interview at high-level tech companies are usually 
encouraged to create useful open-source packages to demonstrate their skills. A quick 
search for adversarial learning across GitHub yields nearly 5,000 separate repositories, 
some with over 1,000 stars (or likes). Career-based incentives have had the net effect 
of democratizing and commoditizing adversarial algorithms, making them ubiquitous 
and reducing their barrier to entry. 
ALGORITHMIC DEFENSES 
A secondary field dubbed adversarial learning or adversarial defenses was created not 
long after adversarial attacks were discovered. These defenses often focus on ways 
to architect or train models, or preprocess data beforehand, to mitigate the effects of 
adversarial attacks.  
This field is still playing catch-up in terms of its overall efficacy. No adversarial defense 
appears to be robust in white-box attacks where the attacker has full knowledge of the 
type of model  and defense(s) being employed. However, many adversarial defenses 
appear to be fairly robust to black-box attacks. Thus, organizations can prevent 
white-box attacks and force attackers to rely on less efficient black-box attacks by 
using a couple of techniques. They can obfuscate the output of a defense, typically by 
reducing its precision, or throttle the ability of attackers to bulk query a defense.  
As mentioned previously, adversarial examples are often transferable, and  
are potentially capable of evading numerous defenses, as recent publications  
have confirmed . 
However, these attacks only evaded products that didn’t employ adversarial defenses 
generated by deep learning. BlackBerry has internally verified that attacks generated 
in this manner are unlikely to bypass models utilizing multiple robust deep learning 
defensive schemes. 
Also, adversarial attacks on files need to rely on iterative approaches that are not 
typically used in other areas (such as on visual or auditory models). As a result, 
many open-source adversarial attack toolkits cannot be easily modified to focus 
on cybersecurity defenses. Unfortunately, a perusal of GitHub  yields a few pages 
containing what appear to be amateur efforts at generating adversarial examples.  
This does not bode well for what may follow as the field matures.36BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
OUTLOOK  
In the near term, the outlook in this area is mixed. The field of adversarial attacks is 
still white-hot, and open-source software has greatly lowered the barrier to entry for 
people looking to generate adversarial examples. The amount of expertise necessary 
to generate bypasses is still quite high. Given this, we do not expect widespread use  
of this technology in the next one to two years.  
Any open-source adversarial packages will still likely need to rely on bulk approaches 
to generating attacks. This means cybersecurity companies have a reasonable path 
forward, which can be summarized as follows:  
 • Hire people who understand adversarial deep learning 
 •  Employ multiple robust defensive schemes (even for products using  
heuristic defenses) 
 • Keep defensive schemes secret / internal-only 
 • Prevent attackers from rapidly querying defenses to find subtle holes 
 Nothing in security 
is guaranteed. 
However, for 
organizations that 
follow these rules,

INCIDENT RESPONSE YEAR IN REVIEW AND TRENDS 
Ransomware has continued to take center stage for the BlackBerry Incident Response 
Team over the last year. As discussed in the BlackBerry 2021 Threat Report , the 
double extortion strategy of ransom and data exfiltration has now become the norm. 
In fact, the trend has escalated, with instances of triple (adding harassment) and 
quadruple (disruptive attacks such as DDoS) extortion occurring. As a result of these 
expanding threat actor strategies, there is an increasing spike in public data leakage.  
Evolving extortion methods have created a close alignment between the tactics 
used by nation-state APT threat actors and profit-seeking criminal organizations. 
Their approaches and operational goals are strikingly similar, although their core 
motivations, levels of technical expertise and methods of execution often vary.  
As such, the vast majority of attacks that occur today follow a similar attack pattern, 
as detailed in Figure 23. 
Figure 23 - Typical threat actor attack flow 
One main difference between APT groups and ransomware organizations is how 
long each group plans to stay active in the environment. This, in turn, affects how 
covertly they behave. APT groups frequently plan for long-term residence in a victim’s 
environment. Ransomware groups are more like smash-and-grab home invaders.  
For example, APTs often prefer to “live off the land” by using legitimate system 
resources so their activity is hard to distinguish from daily operations. They take their 
time to carefully study an environment and understand the security measures in place 
before executing any malicious actions. Ransomware attacks are more opportunistic 
and therefore operate more quickly and recklessly. As a result, they typically generate 
more noise for an endpoint protection platform (EPP) and endpoint detect and 
response (EDR) tooling to detect. For example, they may use tools such as PowerShell, 
Windows batch scripting, or WMI to attempt to disable antivirus products, backup 
solutions, and other system processes.  
Another key difference is that nation-state groups are often looking for specific 
information to exfiltrate. They may use it for intelligence purposes, often in pursuit 
of political or economic advantage. Conversely, ransomware groups often look for 
anything valuable that could increase the likelihood of getting paid. Frequent favorites 
include targeting databases that may contain customer or financial information.

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT In the public eye, size really does matter when it comes to headlines and data leakage. 
Therefore, profit-seeking threat actors will attempt to grab as much as they can while 
they are in the system or network.  
As a result, BlackBerry has observed some automated “scatter-gun” approaches to 
data exfiltration by ransomware groups over the last year. Some showcase nicely 
engineered scripts targeting specific file types to collect: typically Microsoft® Word, 
Excel®, and PDF documents that are under a year old. Stolen data is then uploaded 
to the attacker’s infrastructure. In other instances, BlackBerry identified threat actors 
attempting to compress entire shared drives from the top level within corporations in 
attempts to grab everything available. 
Along with ransomware groups like Conti, DarkSide, BlackMatter, and others currently 
making headlines, there is a new influx of ransomware operations occurring through 
RaaS. BlackBerry has observed several incidents where companies were attacked 
using a variant of a well-known ransomware. However, the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) utilized by the attacker lacked sophistication or depth. In multiple 
incidents, BlackBerry identified threat actors leaving behind playbook text files 
containing IOCs with exact commands, IP addresses, target lists, and more. This 
suggests that the authors of these sophisticated ransomware families are not the 
ones actually carrying out the attacks.  
Financially motivated attackers still focus on low-hanging fruit when it comes to the 
initial compromise phase of their attack. Unfortunately, there was an overabundance 
of targets last year due to continued use of older technologies and infrastructure 
in victim environments, such as on-premises servers. For example, ProxyLogon 
and ProxyShell, common names for two sets of vulnerabilities impacting many on-
premises Microsoft Exchange Servers, were widely exploited throughout 2021. The 
HAFNIUM APT group was first to exploit the vulnerabilities in multiple organizations. 
After publication of the ProxyLogon vulnerability and proof-of-concept exploits, other 
threat actors began rapidly scanning and infecting numerous on-premises Exchange 
hosts. Threat actors exploiting these vulnerabilities often implanted additional 
backdoors, commonly in the form of China Chopper web shells, an increasingly 
popular web shell that packs a powerful punch in a small package. 
Externally accessible RDP continues to be an enduring favorite, however it is  
becoming less common compared to other techniques. Vulnerabilities impacting 
vendor appliances, especially VPNs, firewalls, and perimeter network devices,  
remain the root cause for many incidents. While these vulnerabilities are often  
dated and well documented, BlackBerry observed several incidents where devices 
remained unpatched.  Financially motivated 
attackers still focus 
on low-hanging fruit 
when it comes to the 
initial compromise 
phase of their attack. 
40
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT In other cases, previously vulnerable network appliances were patched, but not until 
after they were already compromised. These incidents resulted in credentials being 
stolen or back doors being installed. The sheer number of compromised environments 
and credentials have bolstered flourishing dark web marketplaces, where premiums 
are placed on domain administrator accounts. However, it is not difficult to find 
company or private credentials that are available for free, as well. 
In addition to the previously mentioned techniques, BlackBerry observed multiple 
incidents involving watering hole attacks. Watering hole attacks provide threat 
actors with a unique way to obtain a foothold and establish persistent access into 
an environment. These attacks targeted users performing legitimate searches for 
business-related material, a common workplace practice. In these incidents, search 
results returned the watering hole URL near the top of the first page of Google™ 
search. The watering hole site presented the user with what appeared to be a helpful 
forum post containing a link to exactly what they needed. It included several fake 
comments claiming that the linked-to file was an exact match to their query.  
If users open the weaponized document, however, malware would download and 
install a Cobalt Strike Beacon, giving threat actors a foothold in the environment.   
REvil  is one of the best-known attack groups currently using this ploy. This threat 
group was initially identified in 2019. They are one of the dominant ransomware 
groups, claiming responsibility for some of the more infamous ransomware attacks of 
the past few years. They were also closely linked to the DarkSide Group, which  
was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline attack. The Russia-linked group has been 
under scrutiny recently and has gone underground on numerous occasions,  
only to reemerge. 
The increasing use of Cobalt Strike is another trend observed over the last year. 
BlackBerry has witnessed it being leveraged as a highly effective and popular post-
exploitation toolkit for several years. Its abuse has continued to increase to the point 
that it is not uncommon to find evidence of its usage during an incident response 
engagement. For those unfamiliar with it, BlackBerry recommends reviewing our 
authoritative new book  on Cobalt Strike, published by the BlackBerry Threat Research 
and Intelligence Team in November 2021. Finding Beacons in

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT ATTACK LIFECYCLE 
The BlackBerry Red Team analyzes the entire attack lifecycle as part of our mission 
and portfolio of service offerings. Our end-to-end adversarial simulation provides 
a unique threat actor perspective, by allowing us to observe the effectiveness of 
different defenses in a variety of organizations. These experiences have prompted us 
to reveal some of the most common attacks and effective defenses we encounter. 
INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE  
The initial recon that an attacker performs can be passive, active, or both. Since 
passive recon does not touch any of the target’s systems, it can be difficult to detect. 
However, once the recon moves to more active and intrusive activities, such as probing 
systems for vulnerabilities, defenders should be alerted. Key defensive strategies for 
this phase involve knowing your organization’s assets, proactive scanning, patching , 
monitoring, and attack surface reduction.  
INITIAL COMPROMISE AND ESTABLISHING THE FOOTHOLD 
Once a vulnerability is discovered during the recon phase, attackers exploit the 
vulnerability and establish presence on the host. From there, threat actors can regain 
entry at a later point and pivot to other systems in the network. This activity  
is something that organizations should detect and block via a layered defense  
of AI-based network and host visibility, and blocking. 
ESCALATION 
Attackers typically gain access equivalent to that of the application they exploited, 
and use that to compromise the host. This is one of many reasons why the principle 
of least privilege  matters. In addition to following best practices, EPP software should 
contain layers of defense to include script blocking and memory protection. The goal Figure 24 - Typical attack lifecycle

is to make it extremely difficult for an attacker to achieve each step in the attack 
lifecycle. Slowing the adversary’s progress also buys time for the defenders to detect  
and block the attack. 
INTERNAL RECON AND LATERAL MOVEMENT 
Once an attacker gains sufficient privileges, they will move through the network  and 
position themselves to achieve their goal. One of the best defenses in this situation 
is to employ network segmentation  and watch for anomalies resulting from the 
use of stolen credentials. In this phase, defensive teams can greatly benefit from 
using AI-powered defensive technology, such as continuous authentication using 
passive biometrics . These passive biometrics are low user-burden activities–such as 
keyboard and mouse usage patterns–that uniquely identify users. An ML algorithm 
can be applied to this metadata to create a risk score. Organizations can then utilize 
actions, such as force re-authentication or block user, when the risk score exceeds the 
organizationally defined threshold.  
COMPLETE THE MISSION 
Before the BlackBerry Red Team conducts an adversarial simulation exercise, we 
jointly define the goals with our clients. This almost always includes some sort of data 
(or flag) exfiltration, since many threat actors are financially motivated. Threat actors 
can get paid in many ways, such as selling stolen data, threatening to sell stolen data, 
or unlocking encrypted data.  
TAKEAWAY 
Here are some helpful universal truths to remember regarding the attack lifecycle and 
cyber kill-chain: 
 •  Be proactive . The “further to the left” you are in the attack lifecycle (see Figure 24), 
the easier and cheaper it is to discover and fend off an attack. 
 •  Anything less than around-the-clock monitoring  is not sufficient. 
 •  The mission of most threat actors today is to exfiltrate data and launch 
ransomware  for profit. 
 •  AI-based defenses help organizations avoid becoming patient zero and  
are immune to the lag time from signature writing that occurs with  
traditional defenses. 
 •  Defensive efforts must always be continuous, due to newly discovered 
vulnerabilities and an ever-evolving threat landscape. 
 •  Prevention is key. The ability to recover from backups does not address the  
double extortion tactic derived from attackers threatening to sell stolen data.Ways threat actors

PROTECTING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
Every organization, in every vertical industry sector, runs the risk of breach, 
ransomware deployment, and extortion. However, few carry the same real-world risk 
from cyberattacks as those in the critical infrastructure sector. The public expects  
that utilities such as power, gas, water, and waste treatment will always be able to 
provide these necessary services. As a result, these organizations are significantly 
motivated to meet these expectations, which makes them lucrative targets for  
ransom and extortion.  
Unfortunately, the challenges for this sector don’t stop at being high-value targets.  
The following factors often compound the problem:   
 • Older, inherently vulnerable, and sensitive devices  
 • Legacy operating systems  
 • The need for offline/disconnected environments  
Many critical infrastructure systems and devices have been around for a long  
time and were originally designed for serial communication, but later adapted to 
ubiquitous TCP/IP networks. This adaptation of connectivity may not necessarily 
include a security upgrade. Since these environments can be difficult and expensive  
to modernize, they typically run older, and usually unsupported, operating systems.  
Often, the need to protect the environments results in segmentation from other 
networks, and hopefully the Internet as well. However, this segmentation poses 
additional management and protection challenges. 
In summary, protections need to be extended to older devices, running legacy 
operating systems, that are disconnected from networks and the Internet. One 
possible solution is the use of machine-learning-based endpoint pr otection that lives 
on the endpoint itself. This type of endpoint protection platform (EPP) software can 
run on legacy operating systems such as Windows XP/2003. If it is lightweight, it  
won’t overtax antiquated hardware. The localized math model must be designed to 
avoid the constant need for deploying signature updates.  
Legacy AV software requires signatures to be written for the latest threats and 
released as often as every hour. This is difficult to keep up to date, even on 
modern hardware and Internet-connected hosts. This makes it a poor fit for critical 
infrastructure that is disconnected and would require a “sneakernet” approach to 
distribute signature updates. AI-based defenses allow a much longer wait time before 
requiring updates, as they identify threats using millions of attributes, not through 
known signatures.  
Critical infrastructure is a challenging environment to secure, but the situation is not 
hopeless. Like other industry sectors, it simply needs to evolve beyond reliance on 
legacy defensive technology that cannot scale to prevent modern cyberattacks. Every organization, 
in every vertical 
industry sector, 
runs the risk of 
breach, ransomware 
deployment, and 
extortion. However, 
few carry the same 
real-world risk from 
cyberattacks as 
those in the critical 
infrastructure sector. 44
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
44PREVENTION-FIRST AI 
AI and ML offer many capabilities and advantages for protecting organizations from 
cyberattacks. While the terms AI and ML are often used interchangeably, they are 
different concepts in certain key aspects. AI describes the ability of computers and 
machines to perform activities that imitate intelligent human behavior. ML is a subset 
of AI that relies on mathematical algorithms to achieve AI behavior and functionality. 
The process behind training ML requires access to vast amounts of historical data as 
a base for its learning. Through multiple phases, new data is introduced to improve the 
ML model’s learning functions before it ultimately becomes a component of AI. 
In fact, ML is only one of six branches of AI. The other branches are neural networks, 
expert systems, natural language processing, fuzzy logic, and robotics. BlackBerry’s 
Cylance AI, for example, combines ML and neural networks to identify and prevent 
cyberattacks before they execute. Because the AI security agents are well-trained 
and extremely lightweight, they can reside upon users’ endpoints without impacting 
resources. These on-device security agents protect devices whether they are online or 
offline. BlackBerry has put considerable research and development funding and effort 
into developing its Cylance AI. We hold hundreds of patents in AI, ML, security, and 
forensics, which puts us alongside other leading AI-centric companies such as Google, 
Facebook, and Amazon. 
ML is classified into two different categories: supervised and unsupervised. These 
classifications describe the ways ML models learn to classify input data into the 
correct output assumptions–in other words, how they make accurate predictions.  Figure 25 - Six Branches Of AI

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT Supervised learning is an assisted process where the math algorithm is guided to 
predict the outcomes from the input of a data training set. With this method, humans 
supervise the ML by manually labeling the training data sets. Supervised ML is like a 
child learning to ride a bike with training wheels. The parent offers guidance until the 
child is ready to remove the training wheels and ride on their own. Supervised learning 
requires incredibly large amounts of training data and guidance before the math 
models can assess the inputs and return the desired outputs.  
Unsupervised ML classifies data into the correct output assumptions without human 
intervention or labelled data. Unsupervised learning is usually the second stage of 
training math models, after they ingest vast amounts of input data from supervised 
training sets. This phase allows data scientists to see how math models run on their 
own, and how well they create the desired outputs. Going back to the bicycle allegory, 
unsupervised learning is the parent removing the training wheels and seeing how well 
a child rides the bike unassisted. 
At BlackBerry, our AI math models use both supervised and unsupervised ML to 
train on identifying a good binary, and differentiating it from a bad one. The data 
sets are extensive and based upon millions of file features. When determining the 
danger posed by a file, its features (everything that makes up the file) are extracted to 
essentially provide its digital DNA. These features are correlated across approximately 
2.7 million others that our math models have previously trained upon. By training on 
such a large set of file features, Cylance AI has learned to quickly identify what is a 
good or a bad (aka, malicious) file.  
BlackBerry Protect, built using Cylance AI, can perform this feature correlation within 
100 milliseconds or less, and, most importantly, it can do it pre-execution. That means 
it stops the threat before it can run. This allows BlackBerry Protect to stop malicious 
files from executing, whether they are known malware or a never-before-seen threat. 
This ability to stop emerging and zero-day malware is called the BlackBerry Predictive 
Advantage . It is achieved by the accuracy of our math models, which can correctly 
identify malicious files, often years before they are seen in the wild.  
HOW IS FEATURE EXTRACTION/VECTORIZATION ACCOMPLISHED? 
For machines to interpret the ML associations of feature extraction and produce  
an output, vectorization has to occur. Vectorization is the process of converting  
input data into mathematical vectors using a format readable by ML algorithms  
and computers.  
Vectorization has been around since computers were first built. It is how ML math 
models can correlate and cluster good file features from bad. It formats file feature 
information in a way computers and math models understand, and allows them 
to provide output. When a file feature, such as code expected in a specific area of At BlackBerry, our 
AI math models use 
both supervised and 
unsupervised ML  
to train on identifying 
a good binary, and 
differentiating it  
from a bad one. AI + ML46BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
memory, is extracted from a file, it is converted into a mathematical value of 1s and 
0s. This allows the ML algorithms in BlackBerry Protect to determine whether a file is 
safe. If so, it is cleared for execution, but malicious ones are blocked and quarantined.  
It should be noted that BlackBerry Protect, in the beginning phases of the algorithm 
learning process, identified approximately 300 million file features. This has since 
been distilled down to 2.7 million critical features it can use to categorize and label file 
safety. Features refer to both what is found in files and what is expected. For example, 
if particular data is expected to appear in a specific part of a file’s DNA but  
is not there, that is also a feature.  
Well-trained AI offers an incredible advantage over human counterparts for performing 
this type of analysis and predictive work. A human analyst might take considerable 
time to identify 150 to 200 features of a file. Trained ML algorithms can identify, 
correlate, and assess millions of file features and determine a file’s threat probability 
within milliseconds. 
A PREVENTION-FIRST APPROACH TO SECURING AN INCREASINGL Y 
HYBRID WORKFORCE  
It’s tempting to blame the massive increase in cyberattacks over the past 18 months 
on the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to a distributed workforce. A recent  
IBM survey  seems to support this view: 
It’s true that expanding the corporate network to encompass the home environment 
and personally-owned devices creates new security gaps for adversaries to exploit. 
But if our current security technologies and practices were robust enough to scale 
gracefully, the transition could have been much less disruptive for many organizations 
than it turned out to be. 
Spear phishing and credential abuse were major problems before the pandemic. They 
continue to account for most breaches today. VPN and virtual desktop infrastructure 
products were vulnerable to exploitation before COVID-19. They still are today. It’s the 
same story with unpatched servers and threats caused by malicious insiders, or by 
users practicing poor cyber hygiene. Longer to identify and contain 
a breach when 50% or more of 
employees work remotely.$1.07M 58 Days
Increase in breach costs  
(from $3.89M to $4.96M) when 
remote work was a factor.47
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT The real problem is that current security approaches are unsustainable because they 
are inherently reactive and unrealistic. A human resources employee responsible 
for examining resumes all day should not be expected to know when a document is 
weaponized, and avoid opening it. SecOps and NetOps professionals responsible for 
protecting a complex and rapidly changing infrastructure should not be expected to 
anticipate and manually quash every possible attack. 
The problem cannot be solved by training every employee to also become a 
cybersecurity expert. It cannot be fixed by adding yet another security tool or layer to a 
fundamentally reactive security architecture. BlackBerry believes that a more realistic 
solution is to transition to a prevention-first security strategy. By leveraging intelligent 
solutions that focus on impairing and impeding cyberattacks, employees can focus on 
the jobs they were hired to do.  
At the device level, this means traditional blocking and tackling. Vulnerable systems 
should be patched and updated. Reactive, signature-based defenses should be 
replaced with AI-powered endpoint protection that prevents the execution of known 
and zero-day malware. 
Next, user-focused security controls should be deployed at every enterprise network 
and cloud application ingress point that prevent remote employees from intentionally 
or accidentally abusing their credentials or violating security policies. Each user’s 
access to resources should be controlled dynamically, based on real-time risk 
assessments of their current behavior. To preserve productivity, this continuous 
authentication process should be as transparent to users as possible, but permit  
no workarounds or evasions.  
Tools that rely on static rules-based analysis cannot achieve this. It’s simply not possible 
to devise rules that anticipate every gradation of risky or anomalous behavior. And the 
retrospective analysis they often produce comes too late to prevent exploitation. That 
requires solutions built with AI that learn how to assess risks and prevent exploitation 
proactively, not respond after the fact when damage is already underway. 
Properly implemented, a prevention-first strategy preserves the flexibility and 
productivity benefits of having a remote or hybrid workforce in the first place.  
Prevention and productivity in balance: The best of both worlds.48
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT EXTENDED DETECTION AND RESPONSE  
Security teams today face numerous challenges. Attackers are swiftly executing more 
sophisticated, stealthy, multi-vector attacks across multiple attack surfaces including 
endpoints, the cloud, networks, apps, and mobile devices. Endpoint detection and 
response (EDR) solutions created a defensive blueprint by delivering powerful threat 
detection and incident response capability for endpoints. However, a more proactive 
and comprehensive protection is needed across the entire attack surface.  
This demand has driven the creation of XDR. It is an evolution of EDR, unifying protection 
at the endpoint with other security tooling. It gives security analysts improved visibility and 
high-efficacy detection, as well as more effective correlation, investigation, and response. 
WHAT IS XDR? 
XDR products are, at their core, about data inclusion and enrichment strategies. This 
means that they incorporate information gleaned from their own product platforms, 
and integrate it with telemetry ingested from partners and other sources. This data 
is combined to create additional context, which is shared as actionable cyberthreat 
intelligence (CTI) within their product.  
When leveraged for threat hunting, combining this novel intelligence allows XDR 
vendors to improve product capabilities and increase market opportunities. This threat 
intelligence enables products to proactively remediate risks, and then inform customers 
of the actions taken to protect their organizations. Better threat intelligence also allows 
product development to be proactive to customer needs and asks.  
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF XDR? 
Enriched threat intelligence, gathered across the entire attack surface, can be 
contextualized to improve human and automated response actions. For example, 
a security analyst may lose considerable time sifting through alerts and threat data 
reported from multiple sources. An XDR platform could intelligently correlate threat 
data from across the environment and forward high-value information to analysts while 
filtering out noise. With enriched XDR data, the analyst has a better understanding of 
the environment and more time to make informed and effective security decisions. 
XDR vendors like BlackBerry understand data and its meaning to the security community 
and to our customers, regardless of structure, origin, or location. We persist data in a 
structure that supports easy shared access and processing, so it can be utilized by all 
portions of our platform.  
XDR vendors can ensure they offer the highest fidelity event alerting by having experts 
who understand and vet the data flowing in from multiple sensors. Professionally 
curated data allows for automated responses to prevent threats and provide 
remediation that continues to improve even as attacks grow more sophisticated. XDR is an evolution 
of EDR, unifying 
protection at the 
endpoint with other 
security tooling. 
It gives security 
analysts improved 
visibility and high-
efficacy detection, 
as well as more 
effective correlation, 
investigation,  
and response. 49
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT HOW IS XDR DIFFERENT FROM SIEM? 
The security operation center (SOC) team’s typical approach of having security 
information and event management (SIEM) on top of all detection products has many 
shortcomings. SIEM solutions are good for collecting and storing logs to help with 
compliance and forensic use cases, but cannot generate high-fidelity detection alerts. 
SIEM solutions do not produce and collect data natively. They simply consume data, 
without gathering or considering context. SOC teams must manually collect and 
correlate telemetry produced in silos, which results in low-fidelity alerts.  
A new architectural approach is required to solve some of these modern SOC issues. 
This is where XDR comes into play. A vendor’s sensor and security agent produce and 
collect most of the telemetry across the attack surface and centralize it into a cloud 
platform. This provides a repository of valuable threat data without requiring manual 
data ingestion, correlation, and enrichment.   
When incidents occur, SOC analysts are often forced to squander critical response 
time manually stitching telemetry to build a timeline summary necessary for 
determining an attacker’s intent. XDR solutions can enable automated threat hunting 
with pre-built attack stories. This automation reduces the time needed to detect  
and respond.  
WHAT SHOULD A GOOD XDR SOLUTION HAVE? 
XDR is a platform that unifies the capabilities of numerous disparate products into a 
single, simple, robust, and customizable experience. It represents the amalgamation 
of intelligence across native and third-party products, allowing for necessary response 
capabilities. In short, effective XDR products should: 
Of course, even the best XDR solutions cannot stop threats by themselves. Some XDR 
platforms may include prevention-first technologies, AI-assisted analysis, and automation, 
but human specialists must still determine what qualifies as a threat in their environment.

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT All of the threat telemetry XDR gathers from primary and third-party solutions must 
ultimately be interpreted by trained analysts. This can make managed XDR services an 
appealing option to organizations operating with smaller cybersecurity budgets.
THE EVOLUTION OF MANAGED DETECTION AND  
RESPONSE SERVICES 
Increasingly complex and sophisticated cyberthreats are changing the way 
organizations approach cybersecurity. Some attackers are shifting their target focus 
from compromising infrastructure to exploiting individuals through increases in 
targeted phishing campaigns. This change, among others, means traditional defenses 
are inadequate for addressing the myriad of threat vectors exploited by contemporary 
adversaries. Organizations looking for detection and response partners today need 
vendors who can address a wide variety of advanced cyberattacks . A brief look at the 
threat landscape shows that organizations face an uphill battle: 
 • 667 million  new malware detections were discovered worldwide in 2020.  
 • There was a 600%  increase in cyber crimes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 • 4 million  additional cybersecurity workers are needed globally.  
 • 1 million  daily security alerts are seen in 25% of SOCs.  
Organizations are operating in an environment of constant change while threat actors 
quietly stalk them, looking for an opportunity to strike. Organizations must find a 
way to forge ahead without leaving themselves open to opportunistic cyberattacks. 
Managed detection and response (MDR) services can help organizations safely 
navigate the troubled waters of insecure technology and a hybrid or mobile workforce. 
MDR platforms offer 365x24x7 professional support for intrusion detection, incident 
response, and threat elimination. 
The HAFNIUM attack of January 2021 offers a perfect example of how MDR assists 
organizations. During the campaign, at least 30,000  organizations in the U.S. were 
compromised by a Chinese cyber espionage unit, known as HAFNIUM. These attacks 
were largely automated, and targeted unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers.  
An MDR team could combat HAFNIUM by gathering and extensively researching all 
available threat intel feeds. Collected information might include IOCs, command lines, 
running processes, registry keys, DNS requests, and more. The MDR team would then 
perform additional threat hunting. For example, BlackBerry teams would continue 
searching for threats by using tools like InstaQuery , which is carried out via API.  Amount of increase 
in cyber crimes due  
to COVID-19.600 %51BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
Through information gathering and threat hunting, an experienced MDR team can 
quickly identify a specific cyberthreat. They quickly provide their customers with 
remediation instructions and best practices, as well as offer updates as more 
information becomes available. Proactive MDR teams could even set up a series of 
HAFNIUM-specific rules directly in an EDR tool–rules applying the techniques found  
in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, for example.  
Given the evolving and sophisticated threat landscape, the need for analysts to have 
holistic visibility and telemetry across security tools has increased. Managed XDR 
builds on the MDR services framework by incorporating XDR visibility across the 
enterprise. XDR platforms unify security-relevant endpoint detections by collecting and 
contextualizing threat telemetry across third-party tools. For example, an XDR platform 
might collect and analyze data from network sources and SIEM, email security, identity 
and access management, next-generation firewall, and more. Managed XDR  is cloud-
native and built on a Big Data infrastructure to provide security teams with flexibility, 
scalability, and opportunities for automation. A managed XDR can offer SMBs a level 
of protection that few organizations can otherwise afford. For example, a managed 
XDR may provide: 
Managed XDR can offer organizations around-the-clock access to seasoned 
cybersecurity professionals using state-of-the-art threat detection and response  
tools. This can give organizations considerable peace of mind and allow them to  
focus on their primary mission instead of worrying about cyberattacks.

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT EXPANDING THE ROLE OF NETWORK SECURITY AND AI/ML  
IN PREVENTING ZERO-DAY ATTACKS 
The network has been the carrier of the most targeted and highly exploited 
vulnerabilities of 2020 and 2021. In 2020, several of these vulnerabilities affected 
remote work, VPNs, or cloud-based technologies. In 2021, malicious cyber actors 
continued to target and compromise perimeter-type devices. Highly exploited 
vulnerabilities  were discovered in many popular cyber platforms, including those of 
Microsoft, Pulse, Accellion, VMware, and Fortinet. This run of successful attacks 
resulted in an increased focus on securing and protecting network connectivity. 
Organizations are turning to newer cybersecurity approaches such as Zero Trust 
Network Access  (ZTNA) , Secure Access Service Edge, and XDR. At a macro level, 
the MITRE ATT&CK  framework has also provided resources that improve the attack 
coverage for network-specific vulnerabilities. Zero-day attacks have encouraged 
security analysts to combine defenses and technologies to strengthen security 
measures. Among the approaches being used are: 
 • Prevention-first technology  
 • Protection-first approaches  
 • Signature-based analysis  
 • AI- and ML-based anomaly and threat detection in the network layer  
 • Advanced correlation across multiple telemetry sources  
The network fabric is also facing major changes. VPN solutions that ar e IPSec-based 
have been a flash point for several recent exploits, highlighting the necessity for 
secure and modern TCP/IP stacks. Similarly, a purely signature-based approach to 
malware requires at least one user to become infected so a malicious sample can  
be obtained. This has driven the rise of AI and ML approaches, which can analyze 
threats in the network layer and prevent zero-day attacks. 
THE ROLE OF AI AND ML 
In network threat detection, AI and ML  play an important role by modeling the normal 
behavior of the organization and its users. They then detect anomalies that do not 
match the behavior of any authorized user. They can also predict whether a particular 
networking behavior has lower or higher probability of being associated with a 
specific user. This provides an effective way to identify C2 beacons, for example, and 
differentiate them from benign process and user-initiated network usage. This AI-
driven, model-based anomaly detection and user-specific prediction capability can 
reduce both false positives and false negatives. 53
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT THE MALICIOUS INSIDER 
For malicious insiders, anomalous access detection and predictive behavior modeling 
on their own may be less effective. The malicious insider will often conform with 
their own past behavior and may share many characteristics with otherwise normal 
user and organizational access. However, overtly malicious, aberrant, or suspicious 
behavior may still draw attention.  
THE MALICIOUS OUTSIDER 
AI modeling is highly effective against malicious outsiders, like those who access an 
unlocked device surreptitiously or obtain illicit access to legitimate user credentials. 
It is much less likely that a malicious outsider’s behavior will continuously conform to 
the compromised user’s modeled behavior. It is also likely the outsider’s behavior will 
conflict with those of the organization as a whole. They may log in outside of normal 
work hours, access new resources, or perform atypical actions such as attempting  
to download databases that quickly identify them as threats.  
MALWARE 
As with malicious outsiders, anomalous or low-probability endpoint access by 
malware can trigger detections. Alerting the legitimate user to the malicious activity 
allows them to halt access and report the issue to their SOC. In addition, malware  
and its associated C2 exhibit networking patterns that are atypical of legitimate,  
user-driven behavior. For additional protection, threat behavior may be separately 
modeled for increased detection. Configuring automated response actions to modeled 
threat behavior protects the environment in cases where the legitimate  
user does not reject suspicious access attempts. 
RULES-BASED NETWORK THREAT DETECTION 
Holistic network protection includes a combination of AI and ML technology and rules-
based network threat detection. For example, IDS/IPS traffic can be used to analyze, 
assess, and filter communications. Traffic can be assessed by pre-created rules, like 
SNORT, then deployed to prevent and detect malicious traffic. A rule can be associated 
with a corresponding response action such as alert, allow, or block. Typically, SOC 
admins maintain visibility into the actions performed by SNORT  
or similar rules. Rules-based detection by itself can significantly increase the  
MITRE ATT&CK coverage in areas such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, 
command-and-control, data exfiltration, etc.  54
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT MICROSOFT HAFNIUM 
The state-sponsored threat actor HAFNIUM utilized patch vulnerabilities in on-
premises Microsoft Exchange Servers to compromise email accounts. Within days, 
malicious actors beyond HAFNIUM began targeting unpatched systems and installing 
malware to ensure long-term access to compromised environments. 
A combination of prevention-first cybersecurity and fast detection technology can 
thwart HAFNIUM-style attacks. Specifically, the vulnerabilities exploited by HAFNIUM 
could have been protected by: 
 • ZTNA principles 
 • A least-privilege approach to access 
 • An identity-aware network platform  
 • Continuous authentication and adaptive access technology 
 •  Remote work solutions that authenticate access to individual applications,  
not the entire network  
VPN EXPLOITS 
Zero-day VPN exploits hammered the industry in 2021, from Sonic VPN, to Pulse 
Secure, to Fortinet VPN. While several of these vulnerabilities have existed for a while, 
recent work-from-home and remote access trends have brought them increased 
attention. As a technology attracts more users and organizations, it becomes 
increasingly valuable to threat actors.  
To avoid VPN exploits while supporting a remote and mobile workforce, organizations 
should consider adopting: 
 •  A software-defined Zero Trust network architecture  
 •  A network built upon a robust TCP/IP stack  
 •  Securing connectivity using the principles of least privilege access  
 •  Solutions offering segmented network access control to separate professional and 
personal network traffic  
 •  Dynamic access controls that can provide just-in-time access to a platform that 
offers full visibility into network traffic across on-premises and cloud resources55
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT MOBILE THREATS AND SECURITY 
Mobile device security should be a serious concern for every organization. Consider 
the current state of the smartphone market, which is divided  between Android™ and 
iPhone® devices. According to recent studies, a staggering 76% of tested mobile 
applications store data insecurely. Insecure apps threaten organizations with BYOD 
policies, and those supporting mobile or remote workers. The danger arises from 
employees increasingly using unmanaged personal devices to perform professional 
tasks. When business resources and vulnerable apps occupy the same device and 
connect to multiple networks, there are many opportunities for disaster. 
Vulnerable apps are not the only mobile threat facing organizations. When personal 
devices store or access organizational resources, there is a risk that enterprise data 
may be unintentionally exposed. Leaks could be as simple as forwarding sensitive 
emails to the wrong address, or as serious as revealing user credentials and 
personally identifiable information. Data leakage can occur through other avenues as 
well, paired Internet of things (IoT) devices and unmanaged network access points 
(such as public Wi-Fi), for example.  
Unpatched and out-of-date software also poses a serious risk to mobile devices. In 
March 2021, Android file-sharing app SHAREit  was revealed to contain vulnerabilities 
allowing remote code execution. Threat researchers were aware of the problem and 
notified the developers in December 2020, but no updates were issued. By the time threat 
researchers revealed the vulnerabilities publicly, SHAREit had over one billion downloads. 
Mobile devices in North America saw a 300%  increase in smishing attacks, or phishing 
attacks via SMS, during the third quarter of 2020. This increase jumped to 700% in the 
first six months of 2021. Smishing attacks arrive as an SMS text message, allegedly 
coming from a trusted contact, and often contain malicious links. For example, a 
victim could receive a text claiming to come from their bank, that states their account 
is overdrawn. The text contains a malicious link and urges the victim to tap it for 
details. If the link is clicked, the victim may initiate a malware download or have their 
information captured. These attacks are easy to perform since all the attacker requires 
is the victim’s phone number. SMS messages also truncate URLs, making them harder 
to visually inspect for warning signs. 
Recently, the deceptive practices of phishing and smishing have evolved into an even 
greater threat–malicious applications posing as legitimate programs. This trend has 
been particularly noticeable with banking, cryptocurrency, and trading apps . Malicious 
applications installed by users enjoy the benefits of implicit user trust. Since the app 
receives the user’s permission to install and execute, it can be difficult for traditional 
cybersecurity approaches to detect. Detection may be further complicated when 
malicious apps are downloaded from trusted platforms. According to recent 
studies, a staggering 
76% of tested mobile 
applications store  
data insecurely. 76%56
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT AI TACKLES MOBILE THREATS 
Organizations faced many security challenges trying to support a remote and 
mobile workforce in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns. Since then, the workforce has 
remained in flux, leaving many organizations searching for effective ways to combat 
mobile threats.  
One promising approach is adopting AI-driven solutions that use mathematical 
modeling and predictive analysis to detect and prevent numerous types of threats.  
For example: 
 •  Vulnerable code in apps.  AI can extract file features from an application before  
it executes, and block those containing malicious or exploitable code. This protects 
users from malware as well as buggy applications relying on vulnerable open-
source or third-party code.  
 •  Data leakage.  Intelligent gateway platforms can offer full/split tunnel capabilities 
that encrypt communications for sensitive data but leave trivial communications 
open. AI plays a vital role in selecting how network traffic is classified, removing 
the risk of human error causing unintentional data leaks.  
 •  Out-of-date software.  AI can monitor devices for outdated software versions  
and misconfigurations. These checks ensure the OS, system libraries, and firmware 
remain updated. 
 •  Vulnerable access points.  AI can analyze the security of Wi-Fi access points to 
ensure mobile traffic does not traverse insecure public or private networks. 
 •  Phishing/smishing attacks.  AI can quickly determine the safety of URLs, 
preventing users from unknowingly browsing to unsafe locations. 
 •  Malicious apps.  AI can detect malicious apps before they are loaded or execute  
on a mobile device. This proactive ability to stop malware is a feature of 
prevention-first  cybersecurity.  
While no solution is 100% effective against all attacks, AI can effectively address many 
of the threats facing mobile technology. AI can continuously make informed security-
related decisions in the background, allowing users to focus on productivity. AI can 
also monitor connections and network traffic to ensure communications remain 
protected while users travel wherever their jobs require–or work wherever their travel 
requires. Because AI is an adaptive technology, it is well-suited to respond to both 
known threats and those which emerge during times of disruption. 57
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT CONNECTED VEHICLES–MOVING TOWARD SECURITY 
The transformational changes occurring in personal transportation underscore the 
need to address the security requirements of these rolling network data platforms. 
The auto industry is exploring constructive uses for AI, including its ability to perform 
critical cybersecurity tasks.   
Understanding how prevention-first AI cybersecurity integrates into connected 
driving is best done by breaking the technology down into the individual elements of 
prevention and AI. Each can be implemented independently of the other. Likewise, 
there is work that must go into each element in order to properly deploy them in 
connected driving. 
PREVENTION OF CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS 
The first step in securing any system is designing and building it in a wa y that 
minimizes the likelihood of security vulnerabilities. This sentiment is reflected in some 
recent guidelines set forth by ISO and the UN: 
 •  ISO/SAE 21434 , published in August 2021, sets the standard for handling security 
during vehicle design, manufacturing, use, and decommissioning. 
 •  UN R155  enforces that cybersecurity be considered, not just in the automotive 
platforms, but in the surrounding infrastructure, as well. 
Prevention and detection of threats, however, are not diametrically opposed. There 
are vulnerabilities which will not be found during system design and development. 
Preventing these unidentified vulnerabilities from being exploited involves detecting 
an attack against the system and preventing it from progressing. The possibilities for 
preventing malicious behavior will be impacted by whether the electronic system is 
safety critical. 
Some electronic systems in modern vehicles must be safety certified. ISO 26262  
defines Automotive Safety Integrity Levels ( ASIL ) A through D. Hazardous events 
are classified according to their severity, exposure, and ability to control the vehicle 
if the event occurs. For these safety-critical electronic systems, any modification to 
their behavior to prevent malicious attacks (including introducing a new prevention) 
requires a re-certification of the system. Re-certification involves performing a hazard 
analysis for every prevention action that might be taken. For electronic systems that 
are not safety-critical, changing system behavior to prevent ongoing malicious activity 
is more straightforward.  
Typically, the implementation of intrusion detection precedes intrusion prevention  
in new environments. It allows monitoring and refinement of the system without 
adverse consequences, until we are confident in its operation and can enable 
prevention-based approaches. For safety-critical 
electronic systems,  
any modification 
to their behavior to 
prevent malicious 
attacks (including 
introducing a new 
prevention) requires  
a re-certification  
of the system. 58
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT USE OF AI 
With AI, the same important distinction between safety-critical systems and other 
vehicle systems arises. The use of AI within safety-critical systems is still being 
debated. One of the challenges of using AI in a safety context is in understanding 
the resulting system behavior. Safety assurance relies on understanding how the 
system will respond to its inputs. An ML-based AI system, where the behavior is 
not well understood, introduces intellectual debt . A system with intellectual debt is 
deeply concerning for safety engineers responsible for certification. Attacks such as 
adversarial machine learning highlight the designer’s inability to fully understand how 
all inputs may affect the actions of the AI system. Data used to train the system might 
also be the target of attack, or not representative of changing real-world conditions.  
It is, therefore, critical to not treat new AI systems as infallible, and to understand  
why they fail when they do.  
Reconstructing the state of a system using AI to perform post-incident analysis 
and discover why it failed will require significantly more resources in many areas. 
Considerable work still needs to be done in reducing the intellectual debt related to AI. 
The Safety of Autonomous Systems Working Group has published guidance  on safety 
assurance of autonomous systems. ISO TC 22/SC 32  has several working groups 
(WG13 and WG14) which are examining the safety of AI and autonomous driving. 
Issues with using ML-based AI in a safety critical system include threats to the AI itself 
and to the data used for training or in production .  
We expect, therefore, that AI-based cybersecurity will find inroads outside the safety-
critical components of the vehicle before inclusion in safety-critical components. 
The BlackBerry IVY™ platform is designed to facilitate the introduction of AI into the 
vehicle, providing intelligent insights to enhance driver and passenger experiences. 
ADDITIONAL AREAS REQUIRING ATTENTION 
The vehicle is only one component in the connected vehicle network. Other systems 
in the connected vehicle network include charging infrastructure, connected 
intersections, and even route finding. Currently, most route finding is done through 
smartphones as opposed to being integrated into the vehicle. Autonomous driving 
at higher levels  is going to require route finding be built into the vehicle. In all of 
these support networks, AI can be used to make decisions based on the data. There 
is the potential for cyberattacks on these networks as well. Factors such as safety 
will continue to influence decisions on how to best protect these networks against 
cybersecurity threats. The vehicle is only 
one component 
in the connected 
vehicle network. 
Other systems 
include charging 
infrastructure, 
connected 
intersections, and 
even route finding. 
59
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT Prevention-first AI cybersecurity does not need to focus exclusively on production 
environments. Preventing the introduction of vulnerabilities during software design 
and development, including those of AI systems, is another avenue through which 
cybersecurity can be improved. The use of AI continues to be researched for fuzzing 
and other static/dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) analysis tools.  
Work is underway within ISO and SAE to determine the necessary cybersecurity 
assurance level for various components in the vehicle, based on the cyberthreats 
they may face. Higher assurance comes from an increased focus in the proper 
design, development, and testing of systems. This will ensure that the chance of 
vulnerabilities remaining undiscovered is minimized.  
The increased focus on the proper design, development, and testing of software is not 
unique to just connected vehicles. With malicious cyber campaigns increasingly being 
waged against the private and public sector, the focus on improving cybersecurity 
extends to all critical  software .
CRITICAL EVENT MANAGEMENT –BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING 
For many organizations, the pandemic brought home the reality that massively 
disruptive critical events can happen at any time. The pandemic, however, wasn’t the 
only disruption in the last 12 months. Supply chain disruptions, civil unrest, utility 
outages, natural and man-made disasters, and even extreme weather were consistently 
occurring throughout the year, and throughout the world. In addition to physical events, 
cyberattacks and other IT disruptions have pummeled business-critical systems, 
according to a report by Aberdeen . Supply chain and utility disruptions of the past were 
often the result of “upstream and downstream” logistic or power transmission issues. 
Today, cyberattacks increasingly play a role in such disruptions.  
A number of high-profile cybersecurity incidents were reported in the first half of  
2021, including: 
 •  Colonial Pipeline.  The Colonial Pipeline Company, owners of the largest fuel 
pipeline in the U.S., fell victim to DarkSide ransomware in May 2021. The attacks 
disrupted operations and forced the company to shut down its pipeline system for 
several days. Colonial Pipeline paid $5 million in ransom, of which $2.3 million was 
later recovered. 
 •  Florida’s water supply.  In February 2021, a cyber criminal infiltrated the water plant 
system for the town of Oldsmar. The attacker tried to poison town residents by 
increasing the sodium hydroxide content in the water supply to dangerous levels. A 
plant operator noticed the increasing sodium hydroxide levels and reversed the attack 
before anyone was harmed. Federal authorities are still looking for the attacker. Colonial Pipeline 
Company, owners 
of the largest fuel 
pipeline in the U.S., 
fell victim to DarkSide 
ransomware in May 
2021, forcing the 
company to shut 
down its pipeline 
system for  
several days. 
60BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
 •  Australia’s Channel Nine.  The Australian broadcaster, Channel Nine, had its 
programs taken off the air by a cyberattack in March 2021. The company struggled 
with the issue for several hours before finding a workaround allowing it to 
broadcast again.  
 •  Accellion supply chain attack.  Attackers breached the Accellion file transfer 
system early in 2021. Through this breach, cyber criminals were able to steal  
data from multiple organizations. 
Many organizations, unfortunately, are ill-prepared for these kinds of critical events. 
The headline-grabbing attacks on supply chains and critical infrastructure in 2021 
raised some serious questions for organizations worldwide. Can these types of 
incidents be prevented in the future? If so, how? What steps could organizations  
have taken to be better prepared to respond to them?  
To address similar cyber incidents, forward-looking organizations are investing in 
recruitment, training, and equipping their security analysts to staff “fusion” operation 
centers. These centers handle critical events related to cybersecurity and IT as well  
as non-technical issues. Their fused responsibilities extend to critical events 
traditionally managed by an emergency operations center, such as civil unrest, natural 
disasters, and safety incidents. They work around the clock performing important 
functions, including: 
Operating a well-staffed fusion operation center is just one aspect of critical event 
response. There are other challenges to consider. Organizations still need to ensure 
there are reliable processes for reaching stakeholders, interoperable response 
systems, and integrated non-SOC systems.  
Successful critical event management (CEM) relies on swift communication and 
collaboration with all affected stakeholders. All involved staff and third-party vendors 
need to be familiar with the organization’s standard operating procedures prior to a 
critical event occurrence. Conducting simulated crisis management exercises can 
raise awareness, preparedness, and ultimately reduce the impacts of critical events.

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
61CEM isn’t confined to large-scale disasters, but includes addressing events with a 
potential to deteriorate and escalate into serious situations. Having a secure, reliable, 
end-to-end CEM platform can help to mitigate any potential oversights that could 
later prove costly. It ensures risks are understood and addressed, stakeholders are 
adequately prepared, threat monitoring feeds are effectively integrated, and resources 
can be quickly deployed. 
Consider the escalating frequency and severity of ransomware attacks. During such an 
attack, an organization’s critical data is encrypted and, in some instances, exfiltrated. 
Threat actors demand a ransom payment for the encryption key to unlock the data, 
and an assurance the data will not be further circulated. If an organization does not 
comply, the attackers may use the data for blackmail, leave it encrypted, or release it 
to the public. Whether the threat actors keep their end of the bargain after  
a ransom is paid is, of course, a gamble. 
Using a CEM platform in this situation, pre-identified stakeholders would already be 
familiar with the expected response procedures. As the incident unfolds, security 
analysts will attempt to trace the initial source and identify affected endpoints. An 
automated workflow can send out notifications to potentially impacted users. These 
notifications may include the nature of the incident, specific warning signs, ways 
to report issues, and any workaround measures. A progress status could even be 
incorporated to provide a quick overview to assist the incident manager. 
Externally, regulators, law enforcement, identified service users, or other partners could 
be notified on the current progress of the incident. Suppose the affected organization 
is a critical care provider, such as a hospital, or a public safety organization. A CEM 
platform would mean having the capacity to effectively ensure that critical services 
can continue to operate. For example, an ambulance’s on-board mobile data terminal 
could be integrated to ensure continuous dispatch of critical information such as 
patient location and data. This could happen while the organization is simultaneously 
struggling to contain and resolve a major disruptive event, like a cyber incident. A CEM 
platform provides the capability to better manage operational disruptions and ensures 
continuous service delivery when threats materialize. 
According to Gartner’s 2021 CIO survey , 64% of employees are able to work from 
home and 40% are already doing so. For this group of stakeholders, the ability to 
communicate and receive vital information during a cyber incident or other critical 
event is crucial. While risks cannot be totally eliminated, adopting CEM technology 
helps augment current preparedness and prevention initiatives, and improves 
organizational resilience.  
For organizations without a CEM platform, or those wishing to augment their 
capabilities, acquiring CEM capabilities as a managed service may be an  
attractive option. Critical Event 
Management

BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT NEW CYBERSECURITY LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES 
AND FORECAST 
Cybersecurity is now at the top of the public policy agenda  for G7 countries  and 
NATO allies . Successive and increasing cyberattacks on pipelines , hospitals , airlines , 
supply chains , and essential services , highlight the urgent need to protect critical 
infrastructure, businesses and citizens. In 2020/21, governments in the U.S., U.K., 
France , Japan , Italy, Australia  and Germany  collectively pledged billions of dollars  
and introduced new measures to strengthen their cyber resilience.  
In the U.S., the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order  in May 2021 designed 
to bolster cybersecurity initiatives across the federal government. President Biden 
nominated a national cyber director to oversee digital security policy and issued new 
measures to protect and secure Federal Information Systems. He also strengthened 
the authority of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to respond to major cyber incidents. Meanwhile, 
Congress has passed legislation to codify and fund some of these efforts.  
The European Union is considering broad cybersecurity legislation covering networks, 
critical infrastructure, and new security certifications for IoT products. In Canada, the 
Federal government has committed to draft a new national cybersecurity strategy, pass 
new legislation to bring cyber criminals to justice, and boost Federal cyber capabilities. 
However, businesses and industry groups  are calling on the Federal government to do 
more by making cybersecurity a top policy priority . The support for stronger measures is 
high, with 92% of Canadians saying that the government should prioritize cybersecurity 
investment. More than 80% of Canadian CEOs cite cybersecurity as a major threat to 
their company’s growth prospects.  
Indeed, implementation of laws enacted in 2021, including the rollout of significant 
cybersecurity investments, will continue into 2022 and include: 
 • Software supply chain security requirements 
 • Consumer-oriented cybersecurity labeling programs  
 • Compliance related to securing critical infrastructure sectors 
 •  Measures to protect government networks and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks 
 • Improvements to public-private collaboration on cybersecurity initiatives 
 •  Accelerating efforts to equip government agencies with the cyber capabilities that they 
need to respond to rapidly evolving cyber risks and cyberthreats 
Government contractors and companies in regulated industries such as energy, 
transportation, finance, healthcare, and defense are likely to see additional cybersecurity 
requirements implemented first. Governments tend to deem these sectors highest  
risk for cyberthreats that could result in widespread economic, national security, and 
societal impact.  More than 80% of 
Canadian CEOs cite 
cybersecurity as  
a major threat to  
their company’s  
growth prospects.80%63
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT UNITED STATES  
2021, like 2020, was another landmark year  for cybersecurity incidents and, therefore, 
cybersecurity policy initiatives in the U.S. As noted above, President Biden issued 
an Executive Order on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity”  (EO 14028). The EO 
called for and has led to new guidance on enhancing software supply chain security, 
among other key cybersecurity initiatives. It launched a multi-federal agency process 
to determine the appropriate framework for requiring a Software Bill of Materials for 
software sold to the federal government. The EO also instructed federal government 
agencies to transition to a more secure, Zero Trust  IT architecture, among other things.  
Additional U.S. government action in 2021 included new cybersecurity requirements 
for critical pipeline owners and operators , high-risk passenger, freight rail, and rail 
transit operators, large airports, and aircraft operators; an Industrial Control Systems  
Cybersecurity Initiative  by DHS, in coordination with the Department of Commerce; 
establishment of a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force  by the Department 
of Justice; and a series of 60-day sprints  to tackle ransomware and cybersecurity 
workforce issues. The President also convened representatives from 30 countries  
for a White House summit to discuss collaborative actions to counter ran somware .  
In the wake of massive cyber vulnerabilities exposed by SolarWinds, Microsoft 
Exchange, JBS Foods, Colonial Pipeline, Log4j, and other high profile and high impact 
cyberattacks, Congress remains keen to raise the bar on cybersecurity to protect both 
the public and private sectors.    
Some of the most notable U.S. public policy developments for enterprise security 
decisionmakers to consider include: 
 •  Cybersecurity-related provisions in the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act 
designed to improve the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) and DHS to 
identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to malicious cyber campaigns 
threatening the public sector as well as privately-owned critical infrastructure. This 
includes requiring DOD to develop a Zero Trust strategy and model architecture for 
its Information Network and expanding eligibility for DOD funding and technical 
support to owners of critical infrastructure. DHS, including CISA, will also expand 
efforts to address cyber risks and enhance cyber incident response, particularly 
concerning industrial control systems. It will roll out a program that provides 
continuous monitoring and detection of cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure 
entities, and establish a national cyber exercise program designed to aid both 
government and industry incident response planning. 
 •  Cybersecurity requirements to harden the pipeline, railroad, and aviation sectors  
against threats in cyber space. For example, in December 2021, the Transportation 
Security Administration rolled out new rules requiring high-risk rail, large airports, 
and aircraft operators to adopt new processes. These include reporting cyber 64
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT incidents to CISA, identifying a cybersecurity coordinator, conducting vulnerability 
assessments, and developing contingency recovery plans to be implemented in the 
event of a cyberattack.  
 •  New software supply chain security requirements  included in the President’s Executive 
Order are starting to take shape as multiple government agencies are beginning to 
tackle this challenging issue. These rules will initially affect federal contactors. While 
focused on federal procurement, heightened software security requirements are likely 
to spill over into private sector practices and requirements as well.  
Government initiatives likely to pick up steam in 2022 include the development of 
additional cybersecurity requirements for the transportation, energy, telecommunications, 
and financial sectors. Should new rules or laws materialize, owners and operators across 
these sectors will be obliged to dedicate more resources to meet new cybersecurity 
requirements. Some Members of Congress will press for increased federal consultation 
with industry stakeholders in the development of these requirements. Industry should 
also expect bipartisan proposals to enact cybersecurity incident notification and 
reporting mandates for critical infrastructure operators and owners, and possibly others. 
Multiple such proposals were debated in 2021 and are likely to be revisited in 2022.  
Finally, government at all levels is expected to continue to move quickly to invest in 
IT modernization, including cybersecurity. These funds are flowing via the American 
Rescue Plan Act signed into law in March 2021, which enlarged the Technology 
Modernization Fund, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law 
in November 2021. Several provisions of this new law make infrastructure funding 
contingent on investment in and planning for cybersecurity for the very first time. 
Local and state governments, likewise, will benefit from $1 billion authorized in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to fund cybersecurity grants for State and  
Local governments. 
CANADA 
Like the U.S., cybersecurity is one of the most pressing challenges facing Canada. 
For decades, experts have warned about the dangers of cyberattacks. Today, cyber 
breaches have become disconcertingly routine . Rightfully, Canadians are worried. 
Notably, falling victim to a cyberattack now ranks second behind job loss on the list of 
things Canadians worry about most . In the past year, Canadian businesses , hospitals , 
universities , transit  systems , cities , and government services  all have experienced 
significant cyber attacks .  
Addressing cybersecurity shortfalls is a high priority for Canadians, as integral to 
building a more resilient, innovative, inclusive, and vibrant economy. Industry groups 
are raising concerns about the ever-growing  set of cyberthreats . They are calling on Amount authorized 
in the Infrastructure 
Investment and 
Jobs Act to fund 
cybersecurity grants 
for State and Local 
governments.$1B65
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT the government  to invest in cybersecurity at a level on par with Canada’s G7 peers, and 
have produced detailed recommendations  on how the public and private sectors can 
collaborate to enhance cybersecurity in Canada. 
The Trudeau government has committed to draft a new National Cyber Security 
Strategy and develop a National Cyber Security Action Plan. It will advance legislation 
to counter cyber crime and enhance privacy safeguards, and equip the Canadian 
Security Establishment with the tools it needs to respond to a rapidly evolving 
cyberthreat landscape. However, many in industry, including the Canadian Chamber 
of Commerce , are pressing the Government of Canada to do more to protect critical 
infrastructure, businesses and communities. Among these recommendations are  
calls for the government to: 
 •  Increase the cyber resiliency of critical infrastructure.  As noted in BlackBerry’s 
2021 Threat Report, Canada’s Critical Infrastructure Strategy is old, dating back to 
2009 . Public Safety Canada has initiated consultations to renew and update this 
strategy, but this could take several years to finalize. In the meantime, Infrastructure 
Canada is moving forward with a National Infrastructure Assessment , which sets 
government priorities for infrastructure investment for years to come. Cyberattacks 
on Newfoundland and Labrador’s  health system and on Toronto’s transit authority  in 
2021, served as an ‘alarm bell’  for Canada to increase investment in cybersecurity 
for critical infrastructure. Transport Canada has made progress on vehicle 
cybersecurity  by issuing concrete guidance and characterizing cybersecurity as 
a foundational element of road safety and security. However, more cybersecurity-
related guidance and regulation are expected for rail, marine and aviation sectors 
given the lack of attention  to date. 
 •  Help Canadian businesses invest in cybersecurity. In April 2021, the Federal 
government pledged $4 billion  dollars to the Canada Digital Adoption Program . 
These funds are intended to help 160,000 small and medium-sized businesses 
buy and adopt the new technologies they need to grow. This was a welcome 
initiative for many, as COVID-19 thrust businesses into an unprecedented reliance 
on digital technology to support remote work and e-commerce. However, these 
same businesses experienced an unprecedented spike  in cyberattacks. To fully 
harness the potential of the Digital Adoption Program, cybersecurity must be made 
an essential element of this program. By leveraging the deep expertise and talent 
of Canada’s private sector, Canada can raise the cybersecurity bar and equip small 
and medium-sized businesses with best practices and tools they need to thrive in 
a data-driven economy. This will also help Canadian businesses comply with a new 
federal privacy and data protection law, which is likely to be proposed in 2022. 
 •  Improve government-wide coherence and action on cybersecurity.  As it stands 
today, cyber responsibilities in the Federal Government are distributed across at 
least 12 Federal  departments and agencies. Creating coherence across government 
to ensure that all departments operate with a unity of effort and purpose is 66
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT essential to fostering cyber resilience. BlackBerry , together with other leading 
technology companies, has called on Canada to consider establishing a senior 
government position like the new U.S. National Cyber Director . This office would 
help elevate cybersecurity in government policy and foster cyber resilience by 
enhancing coherence and collaboration across government. In 2022, we expect 
increased attention to the development of strategies and mechanisms that 
facilitate the implementation of a cohesive cybersecurity strategy across the whole 
of government. Doing so will help the government move from a reactive incident 
response mindset to a prevention-first approach that will position Canada as a 
leader in cybersecurity. 
EUROPEAN UNION 
In 2021, the EU continued its proactive approach to address cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities. The EU Cybersecurity Strategy , published at the end of 2020, introduced 
new measures to enhance collective cyber capabilities. Steps included the creation of 
a new security operations center called the Joint Cyber Unit  where public authorities 
in the EU can network and collaborate to respond to cyberattacks. In addition to new 
cybersecurity initiatives and requirements for government, industry will be impacted 
by revisions to the EU Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive and legislation 
regulating cyber incident reporting requirements for critical operators. 
In 2022, there will be a continued focus on: 
 •  A Commission proposal to address the deficiencies of the Network and Information 
Security (NIS) directive . Notable changes include an expansion in the scope of 
entities covered under the directive. These will now include providers of cloud-based 
services, telecom and electronic communications, intelligent transport systems and 
autonomous vehicles, as well as space technology. The directive also will include 
more restrictive cybersecurity and risk management standards. Changes impact 
encryption and supply chain security, as well as requiring mandatory cyber incident 
reporting within strict timelines. New cybersecurity product certification measures 
for the private sector also are anticipated. Non-compliance could result in GDPR-
equivalent fines.  
 •  An EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework , which will specify security 
assurance levels for ICT-based products and services for both consumer and 
industrial applications. Current focus areas include cloud security, 5G security,  
IoT, and artificial intelligence. 
 •  The EU is also expected to announce a new EU Cyber-Resilience Act  aimed at 
setting new duty of care requirements for software and data in ICT devices for 
manufacturers. This proposal includes IoT devices and software. The goal is to 
ensure security throughout the lifecycle of ICT products, from development  
to end-of-life. 67
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT PREDICTIONS: LOOKING AHEAD TO 2022 AND BEYOND 
While it is impossible to predict the future, we asked our experienced BlackBerry 
experts to share their thoughts on issues that may soon impact cybersecurity.  
Here are some of the topics our professionals will be watching as we enter 2022. 
QUANTUM COMPUTING  
The continued advancement of quantum computing may be as disruptive to the 
cybersecurity space as AI is today, particularly when future quantum computers can 
crack modern encryption schemes in minutes or seconds. Envisioning the overall 
impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity is difficult, but one could begin by 
imagining encryption no longer being a factor. This could be catastrophic, as  
private and public organizations would lose a valuable tool for protecting stolen  
data from attackers.  
Yet, there is another way to look at this problem. Data and communications are 
usually encrypted because of the general belief that motivated attackers will get to 
them. This ignores the possibility that other aspects of cybersecurity may improve 
to the point where data remains fully protected. For example, consider technologies 
fostering a strong prevention-first approach to security, one which identifies and shuts 
down attacks before they execute. If the attackers can never reach the data, then it 
does not matter whether it is encrypted or not. In this way, the advancement of other 
technologies could offset the impending loss of encryption due to quantum computing. 
COVID-19-THEMED ATTACKS 
It is not difficult to predict a continuation of COVID-19-themed attacks persisting for the 
duration of the pandemic. When a disruptive event occurs, there will always be some 
opportunistic element trying to profit or gain from the ensuing chaos. What is more 
difficult is forecasting what the COVID-19-inspired attacks of 2022 may look like when 
they arrive. One possibility is to consider the new COVID-19-related technologies that 
will emerge, and anticipate cyberattacks on those fronts. 
For example, it is not unreasonable to assume that COVID tracking technologies will 
continue to be developed throughout the pandemic. These new technologies will have 
been quickly developed and implemented, making them tempting targets for threat 
actors. Likewise, should immunization passports or similar policies take hold  
in regions, the technological infrastructure behind them may draw the attention of 
threat actors.  It’s not unreasonable 
to assume that COVID 
tracking technologies, 
which have been 
quickly developed and 
implemented, make for 
tempting targets for 
threat actors. 68
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT GOVERNMENTS UNDER PRESSURE TO ADAPT 
Governments are facing increasing pressure to change their approach to combating 
cyberattacks. Attackers are quickly adopting new TTPs to obfuscate their operations 
and exploit their targets. Hostile nation states, once content to conduct their own cyber 
warfare, now frequently outsource their attacks to third-party services or groups. This 
makes attributing a particular attack to a specific threat actor increasingly difficult. 
Likewise, some threat groups study the TTPs of other adversaries, and then mimic their 
behaviors and use their tools to foster misidentification.  
Governments relying on legacy technology and approaches to cybersecurity are 
finding themselves continuously playing defense. Faced with a situation where their 
assailants are unknown and their technology is reactive, it becomes increasingly likely 
governments will adopt more aggressive measures. What these measures may be is 
unclear, but could include prevention-first security tools, Zero Trust frameworks, and 
more intrusive monitoring. 
CHANGES TO THE SOC 
Future changes to the SOC will likely come down to two separate but intertwined 
components: people and technology. Driving the changes relating to people, 
cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated, which means the analysts 
employed to detect them must likewise evolve. The days when security personnel could 
be considered qualified for simply understanding how to interpret an SHA-256  are gone. 
The SOC analysts of today and tomorrow need a deeper understanding of adversarial 
techniques. They must not only be able to spot an attack, but also understand where it 
came from and where it is going. 
This need for increased knowledge will drive the change in SOC technology. For 
example, modern SOCs focus less on singular products and more on capabilities. 
This is why XDR and managed XDR is commanding more attention. The capability of 
a platform to integrate threat telemetry from multiple sources, including third-party 
solutions, and deliver it to analysts is crucial. You need both analysts that understand 
sophisticated attacks and solutions that identify and deliver relevant information, 
regardless of where the threat data resides. We predict the SOC will continue to favor 
highly trained analysts and security platforms that prioritize capabilities over individual 
product strength in 2022. 
SECURITY IN THE METAVERSE 
Much could be said about the wisdom of creating a hybrid-reality where human 
interactions and status largely exists in a virtual capacity. From a security perspective,  
it is important to remember one simple truism: People will trade security for 
convenience. A prime example of this can be seen in the GPS functionality of 
smartphones. Anyone can deny an attacker (or company) information on their Future changes to the 
SOC will likely come 
down to two separate 
but intertwined 
components: people 
and technology. 69
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT geographical location by simply turning off their phone’s GPS location services. Yet, 
anyone trying this quickly discovers many of their applications simply stop working. 
This means, for the sake of convenience, people leave GPS enabled on their phone, 
even though mobile apps are notoriously insecure .  
Now, consider how much greater the risk becomes when it is not simply a cellphone 
location, but one’s entire life being monitored. If information can be misused for profit 
or gain, there will always be an element of society waiting to steal or exploit it. The 
Metaverse requires considerably more user interaction than a cellphone. Therefore, 
it is not unreasonable to assume it would collect much more information and attract 
many more attackers as well. For security to succeed in the Metaverse, it will have to be 
implemented in a way that is robust without negatively impacting user convenience. 
FUTURE OF CYBERTHREATS 
Attackers will continue to exploit events that cause organizations to be more vulnerable 
than usual. This applies to both unforeseen global crises like COVID-19 and more 
predictable occurrences like natural disasters or scheduled holidays. When an 
organization’s security operations are disrupted, it is more likely to draw the attention of 
threat actors who sense an opportunity.  
Threat actors will also continue mimicking the successful strategies and trends they 
observe in the business world. For example, we are seeing more malware built to run 
in cloud architecture. Offerings like RaaS and malicious IaaS are growing. IABs have 
emerged to help common criminals execute more successful campaigns, and to 
aid nation states and other powerful organizations seeking to conduct cyberattacks 
surreptitiously and maintain plausible deniability. Threat organizations are becoming 
increasingly resilient, as we can see from Emotet, which has returned  after a complete 
international government takedown in January of 2021 . Based on these factors, we 
predict technologies and trends increasingly favored by organizations are likely to 
remain prime targets for threat actors in 2022. For security to 
succeed in the 
Metaverse, it  
will have to be 
implemented in a  
way that is robust 
without negatively 
impacting user 
convenience.
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT 
70CONCLUSION 71
BLACKBERRY  /  2022 THREAT REPORT CONCLUSION 
Organized attacks on critical infrastructure and large organizations made headlines throughout 2021, with ransomware 
playing a key role. Threat actors demonstrated their ability to adopt and mimic the private sector capabilities by 
leveraging malicious services (RaaS, IaaS, MaaS, etc.) and using IABs. As attackers continue to rapidly adopt new 
technologies and exploit changing circumstances, it becomes increasingly critical for threat analysts to keep pace. 
This may require investing in XDR-style platforms or managed XDR services that can collect threat telemetry across 
products and devices while separating useful intel from noise.  
Attacks on the supply chain were another major factor shaping the threat landscape in 2021. Threat actors turned 
their attention to service providers, compromising them to launch downstream attacks on their customers. Two supply 
chain attacks, SolarWinds and Kaseya, brought the problem to the public’s attention, but dozens of others occurred 
throughout the past year. Almost two-thirds  of these attacks relied on exploiting the customer’s trust in their service 
provider–yet another reason organizations should consider adopting a Zero Trust framework. 
One particular vulnerability, the Microsoft Exchange Server flaw, wreaked havoc around the globe. First exploited by 
HAFNIUM, several other groups quickly zeroed in on the flaw and launched attacks using the same tactics against 
multiple organizations. While these attacks relied on zero-day exploits, they could have been prevented with a few 
existing technologies. An identity-aware network platform, continuous authentication, adaptive access, and remote 
work solutions that authenticate per-application, greatly reduce the risks of this type of vulnerability. 
Governments remain actively engaged in the cybersecurity space, with G7 countries and NATO allies putting it at 
the top of their public policy agendas. An Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity was issued in 
the U.S., creating new requirements for incident reporting and software supply chain security. The Department of 
Justice established a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force. The European Union continues the work set 
forth in the EU Cybersecurity Strategy of 2020. Measures include creating a Joint Cyber Unit security operations 
center and standardizing a common cybersecurity certification framework. Transport Canada declared cybersecurity 
a foundational element of road safety. Automakers received cybersecurity guidelines from ISO, SAE, and the UN 
regarding the design, manufacture, and use of connected vehicles.  
The events of 2021 serve as a reminder that there is zero immunity to cyberattacks, and no one is safe. SMBs in 
particular suffered countless financially painful attacks that never made headlines. Attacks affecting organizations 
of all sizes were inflicted both directly and through their supply chains. Mobile devices, used by a growing population 
of world citizens, feature apps that are overwhelmingly insecure. The vulnerable SHAREit app for Android devices, 
allowing remote code execution, was downloaded over one billion times before its flaws were revealed. Every 
participant in the digital space, from international corporations down to the individual smartphone owner, remains 
exposed to cyber risks. 
BlackBerry is dedicated to providing advanced cybersecurity solutions to people and organizations worldwide. We 
continue to train and deploy increasingly effective and advanced AI models that predict threats and use prevention-first 
technology to stop them from executing. Our Cylance AI security models, first deployed on endpoints, have been adapted 
to detect threats in the network, user behavior, and beyond.
